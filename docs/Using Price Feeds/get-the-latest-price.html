Data feeds are available on the following networks:
- **EVM-compatible networks**
- [Solana network](../get-the-latest-price-solana/)

To get a full list of supported blockchains for data feeds, see the [Data Feeds Contract Addresses](../reference-contracts/) page.

> 📘 Note
>
> The complete list of data feeds for each network are available on the [Data Feed Contracts](../reference-contracts/) page.

> 📘 New Feed Registry
> You can now use the [Feed Registry](../feed-registry/) to reference data feed assets by name or currency identifier instead of pair/proxy address.

## Ethereum network examples

You can get the latest price of Ethereum (ETH) inside smart contracts. For development and testing, use the [Data Feed for ETH/USD prices](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331) on the Kovan testnet.

You can consume price data from data feeds using examples from one of the following languages:

- [Solidity](#solidity)
- [Javascript](#javascript) with [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
- [Python](#python) with [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

> 📘 Note
>
> This guide shows you how to deploy and interact with data feeds using EVM networks. To learn how to use Solana networks, see [Solana networks](../get-the-latest-price-solana/).

## Solidity

To consume price data, your smart contract should reference [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol), which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.

```solidity Kovan
{% include samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol %}
```

<div class="row cl-button-container">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
      <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.6.7+commit.b8d736ae.js&optimize=false&evmVersion=null&url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol" target="_blank" class="cl-button--ghost solidity-tracked">Deploy this contract using Remix ↗</a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
      <a href="../deploy-your-first-contract/">What is Remix?</a>
    </div>
</div>

The `latestRoundData` function returns five values representing information about the latest price data. See the [Data Feeds API Reference](../price-feeds-api-reference/) for more details.

## Javascript

This example uses [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) to retrieve feed data from the [ETH / USD feed](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331) on the Ethereum network.

```javascript Kovan
{% include samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.js %}
```

## Python

This example uses [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to retrieve feed data from the [ETH / USD feed](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331) on the Ethereum network.

```python Kovan
{% include samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.py %}
```

## Solana network examples

Chainlink Data Feeds run live on the [Solana Devnet](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) with sub-second updates. Chainlink’s Solana deployment has no dependencies on external blockchain networks such as Ethereum.

To get the full list of Chainlink Data Feeds running on the Solana Devnet, see the [Solana Feeds](/docs/solana-price-feeds/) page.

You can view the program ID that owns these data feeds in the [Solana Devnet Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/2yqG9bzKHD59MxD9q7ExLvnDhNycB3wkvKXFQSpBoiaE?cluster=devnet).

### Rust

To learn how to deploy and interact with these data feeds using Solana and Rust, follow the README instructions on the [Devnet Deployment Demo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana-demo).

This demo shows you how to complete the following tasks:
- Deploy your own program that uses Chainlink Data Feeds
- Interact with an account that stores state from a deployed program

In comparison to Solidity, the combination of an account and a program is equivalent to a smart contract on an EVM chain. The demo shows you how to work with a program that you deploy, but you can refactor the client section to work with a program ID of your choice. State and logic are separated in Solana.

## How Do Data Feeds Get Their Data?

Data Feeds are aggregated from many data sources by a decentralized set of independent Node Operators. The [Decentralized Data Model](../architecture-decentralized-model/) describes this in detail.

## More Aggregator Functions

Getting the latest price is not the only data that aggregators can retrieve. You can also retrieve historical price data. To learn more, see the [Historical Price Data](../historical-price-data/) page.
