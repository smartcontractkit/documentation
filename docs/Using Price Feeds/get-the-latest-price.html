Price data feeds are available on the following networks:
- [EVM-compatible networks](#ethereum-network-examples)
- [Solana networks](#solana-network-examples)

To get a full list of supported blockchains for price feeds, see the [Price Feeds Contract Addresses](../reference-contracts/) page.

> 📘 Note
>
> The full list of price feeds for each network are available from [Price Feed Contracts](../reference-contracts/).

> 📘 New Feed Registry
> You can now use the [Feed Registry](../feed-registry/) to reference price feed assets by name or currency identifier instead of pair/proxy address.

## Ethereum network examples

You can get the latest price of Ethereum (ETH) inside smart contracts. For development and testing, use the [ETH/USD Price Feed](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331) on the Kovan testnet.

You can consume price feed data using examples from one of the following languages:

- [Solidity](#solidity)
- [Javascript](#javascript)
- [Python](#python)

### Solidity

To consume price data, your smart contract should reference [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol), which defines the external functions implemented by Price Feeds.

```solidity Kovan
{% include samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol %}
```

<div class="row cl-button-container">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
      <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.6.7+commit.b8d736ae.js&optimize=false&evmVersion=null&url=https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/blob/main/_includes/samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol" target="_blank" class="cl-button--ghost solidity-tracked">Deploy this contract using Remix ↗</a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
      <a href="../deploy-your-first-contract/">What is Remix?</a>
    </div>
</div>

The `latestRoundData` function returns five values representing information about the latest price data. See [Price Feeds API Reference](../price-feeds-api-reference/) for more details.

### Javascript

```javascript Kovan
{% include samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.js %}
```

## Solana network examples

Chainlink Price Feeds run live on the [Solana Devnet](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) with sub-second updates. Chainlink’s Solana deployment has no dependencies on external blockchain networks such as Ethereum.

To get the full list of Chainlink Price Feeds running on the Solana Devnet, see the [Solana Feeds](/docs/solana-price-feeds/) page.

You can view the program ID that owns these price feeds in the [Solana Devnet Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/2yqG9bzKHD59MxD9q7ExLvnDhNycB3wkvKXFQSpBoiaE?cluster=devnet).

### Rust

To learn how to deploy and interact with these price feeds using Solana and Rust, follow the README instructions on the [Devnet Deployment Demo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana-demo).

This demo shows you how to complete the following tasks:
- Deploy your own program that uses Chainlink Data Feeds
- Interact with an account that stores state from a deployed program

In comparison to Solidity, the combination of an account and a program is equivalent to a smart contract on an EVM chain. The demo shows you how to work with a program that you deploy, but you can refactor the client section to work with a program ID of your choice. State and logic are separated in Solana.

## How Do Price Feeds Get Their Data?

Price Feeds are aggregated from many data sources by a decentralized set of independent Node Operators. The [Decentralized Data Model](../architecture-decentralized-model/) describes this in detail.

## More Aggregator Functions

Getting the latest price is not the only data that can be retrieved from aggregators. You can also retrieve historical price data. To find out more, move on to [Historical Price Data](../historical-price-data/).
