## Prerequisites

<Aside type="note">
  You might skip these prerequisites if you have followed one of these [guides](/chainlink-functions/tutorials). You can
  check your subscription details (including the balance in LINK) in the [Chainlink Functions Subscription
  Manager](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions). If your subscription runs out of LINK, follow the [Fund a
  Subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) guide.
</Aside>

### Set up your environment

You must provide the private key from a testnet wallet to run the examples in this documentation. Install a Web3 wallet, configure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), clone the [smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git) repository, and configure a `.env.enc` file with the required environment variables.

Install and configure your Web3 wallet for Polygon Mumbai:

1. [Install Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) so you can compile and simulate your Functions source code on your local machine.

1. [Install the MetaMask wallet](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) or other Ethereum Web3 wallet.

1. Set the network for your wallet to the Polygon Mumbai testnet. If you need to add Mumbai to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#mumbai-testnet) page.

   - <a
       class="erc-token-address"
       id="80001_0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB"
       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#mumbai-testnet"
     >
       Polygon Mumbai testnet and LINK token contract
     </a>

1. Request testnet MATIC from the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

1. Request testnet LINK from [faucets.chain.link/mumbai](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai).

Install the required frameworks and dependencies:

1. [Install the latest release of Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Optionally, you can use the [nvm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) to switch between Node.js versions with `nvm use 20`.

   **Note**: To ensure you are running the correct version in a terminal, type `node -v`.

   ```shell
   node -v
   ```

   ```shell
   $ node -v
   v20.9.0
   ```

1. In a terminal, clone the [smart-contract examples](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git) repository and change directories. This example repository imports the [Chainlink Functions Toolkit NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/functions-toolkit). You can import this package to your own projects to enable them to work with Chainlink Functions.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git && \
   cd ./smart-contract-examples/functions-examples/
   ```

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

1. For higher security, the examples repository encrypts your environment variables at rest.

   1. Set an encryption password for your environment variables.

      ```shell
      npx env-enc set-pw
      ```

   1. Run `npx env-enc set` to configure a `.env.enc` file with the basic variables that you need to send your requests to the Polygon Mumbai network.

      - `POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL`: Set a URL for the Polygon Mumbai testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

      - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Find the private key for your testnet wallet. If you use MetaMask, follow the instructions to [Export a Private Key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key). **Note**: Your private key is needed to sign any transactions you make such as making requests.

      ```shell
      npx env-enc set
      ```

### Configure your onchain resources

After you configure your local environment, configure some onchain resources to process your requests, receive the responses, and pay for the work done by the DON.

#### Deploy a Functions consumer contract on _Polygon Mumbai_

1. [Open the FunctionsConsumerExample.sol contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerExample.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerExample.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

1. Compile the contract.
1. Open MetaMask and select the _Polygon Mumbai_ network.
1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Polygon Mumbai_.
1. Under the **Deploy** section, fill in the router address for your specific blockchain. You can find both of these addresses on the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page. For _Polygon Mumbai_, the router address is <CopyText text="0x6E2dc0F9DB014aE19888F539E59285D2Ea04244C" code/>.
1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract to _Polygon Mumbai_.
1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Copy the contract address.

#### Create a subscription

Follow the [Managing Functions Subscriptions](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#create-a-subscription) guide to accept the Chainlink Functions Terms of Service (ToS), create a subscription, fund it, then add your consumer contract address to it.

You can find the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager at [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link/).
