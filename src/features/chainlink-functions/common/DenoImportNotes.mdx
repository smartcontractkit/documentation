<Aside type="note">
  Functions requests with custom source code can use vanilla [Deno](https://deno.com/). You cannot use any require statements.
  
  It is important to understand that importing an NPM package into Deno does not automatically ensure full compatibility. Deno and Node.js have distinct architectures and module systems. While some NPM packages might function without issues, others may need modifications or overrides, especially those relying on Node.js-specific APIs or features Deno does not support.
