- To write an automated Chainlink Functions consumer contract, your contract must import [FunctionsClient.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsClient.sol). You can read the API reference of [FunctionsClient](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client).

  The contract is available in an NPM package, so you can import it from within your project.

  ```
  import {FunctionsClient} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsClient.sol";
  ```

- The `upkeepContract` address is stored in the contract storage. The contract owner sets this variable by calling the `setAutomationCronContract` function. **Note**: This variable is used by the `onlyAllowed` to ensure only the upkeep contract can call the `sendRequestCBOR` function.

  ```
  address public upkeepContract
  ```

- The encoded `request`, `subscriptionId`, `gasLimit`, and `jobId` are stored in the contract storage. The contract owner sets these variables by calling the `updateRequest` function. **Note**: The request (source code, secrets, if any, and arguments) is encoded offchain.

- The latest request id, latest received response, and latest received error (if any) are defined as state variables:

  ```
  bytes32 public s_lastRequestId;
  bytes public s_lastResponse;
  bytes public s_lastError;
  ```

- We define the `Response` event that your smart contract will emit during the callback

  ```
  event Response(bytes32 indexed requestId, bytes response, bytes err);
  ```

- Pass the router address for your network when you deploy the contract:

  ```
  constructor(address router) FunctionsClient(router)
  ```

- The two remaining functions are:

  - `sendRequestCBOR` for sending a request already encoded in `bytes`. It sends the request to the router by calling the `FunctionsClient` `sendRequest` function.

  - `fulfillRequest` to be invoked during the callback. This function is defined in `FunctionsClient` as `virtual` (read `fulfillRequest` [API reference](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client/#fulfillrequest)). So, your smart contract must override the function to implement the callback. The implementation of the callback is straightforward: the contract stores the latest response and error in `s_lastResponse` and `s_lastError` before emitting the `Response` event.

    ```
    s_lastResponse = response;
    s_lastError = err;
    emit Response(requestId, s_lastResponse, s_lastError);
    ```
