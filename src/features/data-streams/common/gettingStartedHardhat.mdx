This guide shows you how to read data from a Data Streams stream, verify the answer onchain, and store it.

This example uses the _[Streams Trade](/data-streams/streams-trade) implementation_, with a [Chainlink Automation Log Trigger](/chainlink-automation/guides/log-trigger) to check for events that require data. For this example, the log trigger comes from a simple emitter contract. Chainlink Automation then uses `StreamsLookup` to retrieve a signed report from the Data Streams Aggregation Network, return the data in a callback, and run the [`performUpkeep` function](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#performupkeep-function-for-log-triggers) on your registered upkeep contract. The `performUpkeep` function calls the `verify` function on the verifier contract.

Note: To learn how to use the _[Streams Direct](/data-streams/streams-direct) implementation_ of Data Streams, see the [Fetch and decode reports via a REST API](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct/streams-direct-api) guide or the [Stream and decode reports via WebSocket](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct/streams-direct-ws) guide.

## Before you begin

- Chainlink Data Streams is available in Early Access. [Contact
  us](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/datastreams?typeform-source=docs.chain.link#ref_id=docs) to request
  mainnet or testnet early access.
- This guide uses the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) development environment to deploy and interact with the contracts. To learn more about Hardhat, read the [Hardhat Documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started).

### Requirements

- **Git**: Make sure you have Git installed. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="git --version" code/> in your terminal and download the latest version from the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if necessary.
- **Nodejs** and **npm**: [Install the latest release of Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Optionally, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) to switch between installed Node.js versions with <CopyText text="nvm use 20" code/>. To ensure you are running the correct version in a terminal, type <CopyText text="node -v" code/>.
  ```bash
   $ node -v
   v20.11.0
  ```
- **Testnet funds**: This guide requires testnet ETH and LINK on Arbitrum Sepolia. Both are available at [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia).

## Tutorial

### Setup

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples) that contains the Hardhat project setup for this guide. This repository contains the Solidity contracts and the Hardhat configuration files you need to deploy and interact with the contracts.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git
   cd smart-contract-examples/data-streams/getting-started/hardhat
   ```

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Set an encryption password for your environment variables. This password needs to be set each time you create or restart a terminal session.

   ```bash
   npx env-enc set-pw
   ```

1. Set the required environment variables using the following command:

   ```bash
   npx env-enc set
   ```

   - `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key for your testnet wallet that will deploy and interact with the contracts. If you use MetaMask, follow the instructions to [Export a Private Key](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).
   - `ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) URL for the Arbitrum Sepolia network. You can obtain one by creating an account on [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) and setting up an Arbitrum Sepolia project.

### Deploy the upkeep and the log emitter contracts

Deploy an upkeep contract that is enabled to retrieve data from Data Streams. For this example, you will read from the ETH/USD stream with ID `0x000359843a543ee2fe414dc14c7e7920ef10f4372990b79d6361cdc0dd1ba782` on Arbitrum Sepolia. See the [Data Streams Crypto Addresses](/data-streams/crypto-streams) page for a complete list of available crypto assets, IDs, and verifier proxy addresses.

Execute the following command to deploy the Chainlink Automation upkeep contract and the Log Emitter contract to the Arbitrum Sepolia network.

```bash
npx hardhat deployAll --network arbitrumSepolia
```

Expect output similar to the following in your terminal:

```bash
ℹ Deploying StreamsUpkeepRegistrar contract...
✔ StreamsUpkeepRegistrar deployed at: 0x48403478Aa021A9BC30Da0BDE47cbc155CcA8916
ℹ Deploying LogEmitter contract...
✔ LogEmitter deployed at: 0xD721337a827F9D814daEcCc3c7e72300af914BFE
✔ All contracts deployed successfully.
```

Save the deployed contract addresses for both contracts. You will use these addresses later.

### Fund the upkeep contract

In this example, the upkeep contract pays for onchain verification of reports from Data Streams. The Automation subscription does not cover the cost. Transfer `1.5` testnet LINK to the upkeep contract address you saved earlier. You can retrieve unused LINK later.

```bash
npx hardhat transfer-link --recipient <StreamsUpkeepRegistrarAddress> --amount 1500000000000000000 --network arbitrumSepolia
```

Replace `<StreamsUpkeepRegistrarAddress>` with the address of the `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` contract you saved earlier.

Expect output similar to the following in your terminal:

```bash
ℹ Starting LINK transfer from <YOUR_ADDRESS> to the streams upkeep contract at 0xD721337a827F9D814daEcCc3c7e72300af914BFE
ℹ LINK token address: 0xb1D4538B4571d411F07960EF2838Ce337FE1E80E
ℹ LINK balance of sender 0x45C90FBb5acC1a5c156a401B56Fea55e69E7669d is 6.5 LINK
✔ 1.5 LINK were sent from 0x45C90FBb5acC1a5c156a401B56Fea55e69E7669d to 0xD721337a827F9D814daEcCc3c7e72300af914BFE. Transaction Hash: 0xf241bf4415ec081325ccd8ec3d54432e424afd16f1c81fa78b291ae9a0c03ce2
```

### Register and fund the upkeep

Programmatically register and fund a new `Log Trigger` upkeep with 1 LINK:

```bash
npx hardhat registerAndFundUpkeep --streams-upkeep <StreamsUpkeepRegistrarAddress> --log-emitter <LogEmitterAddress> --network arbitrumSepolia
```

Replace `<StreamsUpkeepRegistrarAddress>` and `<LogEmitterAddress>` with the addresses of your `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` and `LogEmitter` contracts.

Expect output similar to the following in your terminal:

```bash
✔ Upkeep registered and funded with 1 LINK successfully.
```

### Emit a log

Now, you can use your emitter contract to emit a log and initiate the upkeep, which retrieves data for the specified stream ID.

```bash
npx hardhat emitLog --log-emitter <LogEmitterAddress> --network arbitrumSepolia
```

Replace `<LogEmitterAddress>` with the address of your `LogEmitter` contract.

Expect output similar to the following in your terminal:

```bash
✔ Log emitted successfully in transaction: 0x236ee95faade12d1b6d497ee2e51ddf957f7d4986ffe51d784b923081ed440ff
```

After the transaction is complete, the log is emitted, and the upkeep is triggered.

### View the retrieved price

The retrieved price is stored in the `lastDecodedPrice` contract variable and emitted in the logs. To see the price retrieved by the `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` contract:

```bash
npx hardhat getLastRetrievedPrice --streams-upkeep <StreamsUpkeepRegistrarAddress> --network arbitrumSepolia
```

Replace `<StreamsUpkeepRegistrarAddress>` with the address of your `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` contract.

Expect output similar to the following in your terminal:

```bash
✔ Last Retrieved Price: 2945878120219995000000
```

The answer on the ETH/USD stream uses 18 decimal places, so an answer of `2945878120219995000000` indicates an ETH/USD price of 2,945.878120219995. Some streams may use a different number of decimal places for answers. See the [Data Streams Crypto Addresses](/data-streams/crypto-streams) page for more information.

Alternatively, you can view the price emitted in the logs for your upkeep transaction.

You can find the upkeep transaction hash at [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia) and view the transaction logs in the [Arbitrum Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/).

## Examine the code

The example code you deployed has all the interfaces and functions required to work with Chainlink Automation as an upkeep contract. It follows a similar flow to the trading flow in the [Architecture](/data-streams/architecture#example-trading-flow-using-streams-trade) documentation but uses a basic log emitter to simulate the client contract that would initiate a `StreamsLookup`. After the contract receives and verifies the report, `performUpkeep` stores the price from the report in the `lastDecodedPrice` and emits a `PriceUpdate` log message with the price. You could modify this to use the data in a way that works for your specific use case and application.

The code example uses `revert` with `StreamsLookup` to convey call information about what streams to retrieve. See the [EIP-3668 rationale](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668#rationale) for more information about how to use `revert` in this way.

<CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsUpkeepRegistrar.sol" />

### Initializing the contract

When you deploy the contract, you define:

1. The verifier proxy address that you can find on the [Data Stream Addresses](/data-streams/crypto-streams) page. The `IVerifierProxy` interface provides the following functions:

   - The `s_feeManager` function to estimate the verification fees.
   - The `verify` function to verify the report onchain.

2. The LINK token address. This address is used to register and fund your upkeep. You can find the LINK token address on the [Chainlink Token Addresses](/resources/link-token-contracts) page.

3. The registrar's contract address. This address is used to register your upkeep. You can find the registrar contract addresses on the [Chainlink Automation Supported Networks](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks) page.

### Funding the upkeep contract

In this example, you must fund the `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` contract with testnet LINK tokens to pay the onchain report verification fees. You can use the [`transfer-link`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/data-streams/getting-started/hardhat/tasks/transfer-link.js) task to transfer LINK tokens to the `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` contract you deployed.

The `transfer-link` Hardhat task sets up the necessary parameters for the LINK token transfer and submits the transfer request to the LINK token contract using the `transfer` function.

**Note:** Funding the `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` contract is distinct from funding your Chainlink Automation upkeep to pay the fees to perform the upkeep.

### Registering the upkeep

You need to register your log-triggered upkeep with the Chainlink Automation registrar. You can use the [`registerAndFundLogUpkeep`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/data-streams/getting-started/hardhat/tasks/registerAndFundLogUpkeep.js) task to programmatically register the `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` and `LogEmitter` contracts with the Chainlink Automation registrar. The task also funds the upkeep with 1 testnet LINK token.

The `registerAndFundLogUpkeep` Hardhat task sets up the necessary parameters for upkeep registration, including trigger configuration for a Log Emitter contract, and submits the registration request to the registrar contract via the `registerAndPredictID` function.

You can use the [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/) to view the registered upkeep and the upkeep's configuration.

### Emitting a log, retrieving, and verifying the report

You can use the [`emitLog` task](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/data-streams/getting-started/hardhat/tasks/emitLog.js) to emit a log from the `LogEmitter` contract.

    1. The emitted log triggers the Chainlink Automation upkeep.
    1. Chainlink Automation then uses `StreamsLookup` to retrieve a signed report from the Data Streams Aggregation Network, returns the data in a callback (`checkCallback`), and runs the `performUpkeep` function on your registered upkeep contract.
    1. The `performUpkeep` function calls the `verify` function on the verifier contract to verify the report onchain.
    1. In this example, the `performUpkeep` function also stores the price from the report in the `lastDecodedPrice` state variable and emits a `PriceUpdate` log message with the price.

### Viewing the retrieved price

The [`getLastRetrievedPrice`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/data-streams/getting-started/hardhat/tasks/getLastRetrievedPrice.js) Hardhat task retrieves the last price updated by the `performUpkeep` function in the `lastDecodedPrice` state variable of the `StreamsUpkeepRegistrar` contract.

### Feed ID types and conversion

Chainlink Data Streams uses different data types for feed IDs at different stages of the process:

- The [`StreamsLookup` error](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/interfaces/StreamsLookupCompatibleInterface.sol#L6) requires feed IDs to be provided as an array of `string`,
- The decoded reports within the contract use `bytes32` types for feed IDs (see the [Report Schemas](/data-streams/reference/report-schema) reference).

If your application needs to compare the feed ID(s) sent in the `StreamsLookup` with those received in the report(s), you must convert between `string` and `bytes32` types.

### Optional: Handle Data Streams fetching errors offchain with `checkErrorHandler`

When Automation detects the triggering event, it runs the `checkLog` function of your upkeep contract, which includes a `StreamsLookup` revert custom error. The `StreamsLookup` revert enables your upkeep to fetch a report from the Data Streams Aggregation Network. If the report is fetched successfully, the `checkCallback` function is evaluated offchain. Otherwise, the `checkErrorHandler` function is evaluated offchain to determine what Automation should do next.

In this example, the `checkErrorHandler` is set to always return `true` for `upkeepNeeded`. This implies that the upkeep is always triggered, even if the report fetching fails. You can modify the `checkErrorHandler` function to handle errors offchain in a way that works for your specific use case.
