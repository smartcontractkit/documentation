<Aside type="caution" title="Onchain data verification">
  In this tutorial, you decode the `FullReport` payload to extract the report data and log it to the terminal. In a
  production environment, verify the data onchain to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the report. See the
  [Onchain data verification](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-onchain-verification) guide for
  details.
