The Chainlink Automation StreamsLookup error handler provides insight into potential errors or edge cases in StreamsLookup upkeeps. The table below outlines a range of error codes and the behavior associated with the codes. Use the `checkErrorHandler` function to specify how you want to respond to the error codes. `checkErrorHandler` is simulated offchain and determines what action for Automation to take onchain in `performUpkeep`.

## Error handler

When Automation detects an event, it runs the `checkLog` function, which includes a [StreamsLookup revert](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#streamslookup-revert) custom error. The StreamsLookup revert enables your upkeep to fetch a report from Data Streams. If reports are fetched successfully, the [`checkCallback`](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#checkcallback-function) function is evaluated offchain. Otherwise, the `checkErrorHandler` function is evaluated offchain to determine what Automation should do next. Both of these functions have the same output types (`bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData`), which Automation uses to run `performUpkeep` onchain. The [example code](#example-code) also shows each function outlined in the diagram below:

If the Automation network fails to get the requested reports, an error code is sent to the `checkErrorHandler` function in your contract. If your contract doesn't have the `checkErrorHandler` function, nothing will happen. If your contract has the `checkErrorHandler` function, it is evaluated offchain to determine what to do next. For example, you could intercept or ignore certain errors and decide not to run `performUpkeep` in those cases, in order to save time and gas. For other errors, you can execute an alternative path within `performUpkeep`, and the upkeep runs the custom logic you define in your `performUpkeep` function to handle those errors.

1. Add the `checkErrorHandler` function in your contract to specify how you want to handle [error codes](#error-codes). For example, you could decide to ignore any codes related to bad requests or incorrect input, without running `performUpkeep` onchain:

   ```solidity
   /**
    * @notice Determines the need for upkeep in response to an error from Data Streams.
    * @param errorCode The error code returned by the Data Streams lookup.
    * @param extraData Additional context or data related to the error condition.
    * @return upkeepNeeded Boolean indicating whether upkeep is needed based on the error.
    * @return performData Data to be used if upkeep is performed, encoded with success state and error context.
    */
   function checkErrorHandler(
     uint errorCode,
     bytes calldata extraData
   ) external returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData) {
     // Add custom logic to handle errors offchain here
     bool _upkeepNeeded = true;
     bool reportSuccess = false;
     if (errorCode == 808400) {
       // Handle bad request errors code offchain.
       // In this example, no upkeep needed for bad request errors.
       _upkeepNeeded = false;
     } else {
       // Handle other errors as needed.
     }
     return (_upkeepNeeded, abi.encode(reportSuccess, abi.encode(errorCode, extraData)));
   }
   ```

1. Define custom logic for the alternative path within `performUpkeep`, to handle any error codes you did not intercept offchain in `checkErrorHandler`:

   ```solidity
   // function will be performed on-chain
   function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external {
     // Decode incoming performData
     (bool reportSuccess, bytes memory payload) = abi.decode(performData, (bool, bytes));

     if (reportSuccess) {
       // Decode the performData bytes passed in by CL Automation.
       // This contains the data returned by your implementation in checkCallback().
       (bytes[] memory signedReports, bytes memory extraData) = abi.decode(payload, (bytes[], bytes));
       // Logic to verify and decode report
       // ...
     } else {
       // Handle error condition
       (uint errorCode, bytes memory extraData) = abi.decode(payload, (uint, bytes));
       // Custom logic to handle error codes
     }
   }
   ```

### Testing checkErrorHandler

`checkErrorHandler` is simulated offchain. When `upkeepNeeded` returns `true`, Automation runs `performUpkeep` onchain using the `performData` from `checkErrorHandler`. If the `checkErrorHandler` function itself reverts, `performUpkeep` does not run.

If you need to force errors in StreamsLookup while testing, you can try the following methods:

- Not specifying any `feedID` to force error code 808400 (`ErrCodeStreamsBadRequest`)
- Specifying an incorrect `feedID` to force error code 808401 (`ErrCodeStreamsBadRequest`)
- Specifying a future timestamp to force error code 808206 (where partial content is received) for both single `feedID` and bulk `feedID` requests
- Specifying old timestamps for reports not available anymore yields either error code 808504 (no response) or 808600 (bad response), depending on which service calls the timeout request

If your [StreamsLookup revert](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#streamslookup-revert) function is defined incorrectly in your smart contracts, the nodes will not be able to decode it.
