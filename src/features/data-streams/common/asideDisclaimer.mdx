  interact with Chainlink's systems and services so that you can integrate them into your own. This template is provided
  "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, has not been audited, and may be missing key checks or
  error handling to make the usage of the product more clear. Do not use the code in this example in a production
  environment without completing your own audits and application of best practices. Neither Chainlink Labs, the
