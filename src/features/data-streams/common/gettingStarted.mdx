This guide shows you how to read data from a Data Streams feed, verify the answer onchain, and store it.

This example uses the _[Streams Trade](/data-streams#streams-trade-using-data-streams-with-chainlink-automation) implementation_, with a [Chainlink Automation Log Trigger](/chainlink-automation/guides/log-trigger) to check for events that require data. For this example, the log trigger comes from a simple emitter contract. Chainlink Automation then uses `StreamsLookup` to retrieve a signed report from the Data Streams Aggregation Network, return the data in a callback, and run the [`performUpkeep` function](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#performupkeep-function-for-log-triggers) on your registered upkeep contract. The `performUpkeep` function calls the `verify` function on the verifier contract.

Note: To learn how to use the _[Streams Direct](/data-streams#streams-direct-using-data-streams-with-your-own-bot) implementation_ of Data Streams, see the [Fetch and decode reports via a REST API](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct/streams-direct-api) guide or the [Stream and decode reports via WebSocket](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct/streams-direct-ws) guide.

## Tutorial

### Deploy the Chainlink Automation upkeep contract

Deploy an upkeep contract that is enabled to retrieve data from Data Streams. For this example, you will read from the ETH/USD Data Streams feed on Arbitrum Sepolia. This feed ID is <CopyText text="0x000359843a543ee2fe414dc14c7e7920ef10f4372990b79d6361cdc0dd1ba782" code/>. See the [Data Streams Feed IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page for a complete list of available assets.

1. [Open the StreamsUpkeep.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/DataStreams/StreamsUpkeep.sol) contract in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsUpkeep.sol" showButtonOnly />

1. Select the `StreamsUpkeep.sol` contract in the **Solidity Compiler** tab.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/solidity-compiler.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Solidity Compiler"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Compile the contract. You can ignore the warning messages for this example.

1. Open MetaMask and set the network to _Arbitrum Sepolia_. If you need to add Arbitrum Sepolia to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#arbitrum-sepolia-testnet) page.

   - <a
       class="erc-token-address"
       id="421614_0xb1D4538B4571d411F07960EF2838Ce337FE1E80E"
       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#arbitrum-sepolia-testnet"
     >
       Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and LINK token contract
     </a>

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/injected-provider.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Injected Provider MetaMask"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. In the **Contract** section, select the `StreamsUpkeep` contract and fill in the **verifier proxy address** corresponding to the Data Streams feed you want to read from. You can find this address on the [Data Streams Feed IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page. The verifier proxy address for the ETH/USD feed on Arbitrum Sepolia is <CopyText text="0x2ff010DEbC1297f19579B4246cad07bd24F2488A" code/>.

     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Remix Deploy Upkeep Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to ensure you deploy the contract to _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Save this contract address for later.

   />

### Deploy the emitter contract

This contract emits logs that trigger the upkeep. This code can be part of your dApp. For example, you might emit log triggers when your users initiate a trade or other action requiring data retrieval. For this Getting Started guide, use a very simple emitter so you can test the upkeep and data retrieval.

1. [Open the LogEmitter.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/DataStreams/LogEmitter.sol) contract in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/LogEmitter.sol" showButtonOnly />

1. Under the **Solidity Compiler** tab, select the `0.8.19` Solidity compiler and click the **Compile LogEmitter.sol** button to compile the contract.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/compile-logemitter.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Remix Compile Log Emitter Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Open MetaMask and make sure the network is still set to _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, ensure the **Environment** is still set to _Injected Provider - MetaMask_.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/injected-provider.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Injected Provider MetaMask"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to ensure you deploy the contract to _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/deploy-logemitter.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Deploy Emitter Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Save this contract address for later.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/deployed-logemitter.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Deployed Emitter Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

### Register the upkeep

Register a new **Log trigger** upkeep. See [Automation Log Triggers](/chainlink-automation/guides/log-trigger) to learn more about how to register Log Trigger upkeeps.

1. Go to the [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia) for _Arbitrum Sepolia_ and connect your browser wallet.

1. Click **Register new Upkeep**.

1. Select the **Log trigger** upkeep type and click **Next**.

1. Specify the upkeep contract address you saved earlier as the **Contract to automate**. In this example, you can ignore the warning about the Automation compatible contract verification. Click **Next**.

1. Specify the emitter contract address that you saved earlier. This tells Chainlink Automation what contracts to watch for log triggers. Then click **Next**.

1. Provide the ABI if the contract is not validated. To find the ABI of your contract in Remix, navigate to the **Solidity Compiler** tab. Then, copy the ABI to your clipboard using the button at the bottom of the panel.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/remix-copy-abi.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Remix Log Emitter ABI"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Select the `Log` event as the triggering event in the **Emitted log** dropdown. **Log index topic filters** are optional filters to narrow the logs you want to trigger your upkeep. For this example, leave the field blank. Click **Next**.

1. Specify a name for the upkeep.

1. Specify a **Starting balance** of 1 testnet LINK for this example. You can retrieve unused LINK later.

1. Leave the **Check data** value and other fields blank for now, and click **Register Upkeep**. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Wait for the transaction to complete.

### Fund the upkeep contract

In this example, the upkeep contract pays for onchain verification of reports from Data Streams. The Automation subscription does not cover the cost.

Open MetaMask and send 1 testnet LINK on _Arbitrum Sepolia_ to the upkeep contract address you saved earlier.

    <ClickToZoom
      src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/fund-deployed-upkeep.webp"
      alt="Chainlink Data Streams Fund Deployed Upkeep"
      style="max-width: 70%;"
    />

### Emit a log

You can use your emitter contract to emit a log and initiate the upkeep, which retrieves data for the specified Data Streams feed ID.

1. In Remix, on the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, expand your emitter contract under the **Deployed Contracts** section.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/emitter-emitlog.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Emit Log"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Click the `emitLog` button to call the function and emit a log. MetaMask prompts you to accept the transaction.

After the transaction is complete, the log is emitted, and the upkeep is triggered. You can find the upkeep transaction hash in the [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia). Check to make sure the transaction is successful.

    <ClickToZoom src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/request-fulfilled.webp" />

### View the retrieved price

The retrieved price is stored in a storage variable and emitted in the logs.

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the details of your upkeep contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1. Click the `last_retrieved_price` getter function to view the retrieved price. The answer on the ETH/USD feed uses 18 decimal places, so an answer of `248412100000000000` indicates an ETH/USD price of 2,484.121. Each Data Streams feed uses a different number of decimal places for answers. See the [Data Streams Feed IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page for more information.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/data-streams/getting-started/deployed-upkeep-2.webp"
     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Deployed Upkeep"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

Alternatively, you can view the price emitted in the logs for your upkeep transaction. You can find the upkeep transaction hash at [Chainlink Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia) and view the transaction logs in the [Arbitrum Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/).

## Examine the code

The example code you deployed has all the interfaces and functions required to work with Chainlink Automation as an upkeep contract. It follows a similar flow to the trading flow in the [Architecture](/data-streams/architecture#example-trading-flow-using-streams-trade) documentation but uses a basic log emitter to simulate the client contract that would initiate a `StreamsLookup`. After the contract receives and verifies the report, `performUpkeep` stores the price from the report in the `last_retrieved_price` and emits a `PriceUpdate` log message with the price. You could modify this to use the data in a way that works for your specific use case and application.

The code example uses `revert` with `StreamsLookup` to convey call information about what streams to retrieve. See the [EIP-3668 rationale](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668#rationale) for more information about how to use `revert` in this way.

<CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/StreamsUpkeep.sol" />

### Initializing the upkeep contract

When deploying the contract, you define the verifier proxy address for the Data Streams feed you want to read from. You can find this address on the [Data Streams Feed IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page. The verifier proxy address provides functions that are required for this example:

- The `s_feeManager` function to estimate the verification fees.
- The `verify` function to verify the report onchain.

### Emitting a log, retrieving, and verifying the report

After registering your upkeep contract with Chainlink Automation with a log trigger, you can emit a log with the `emitLog` function from your emitter contract.

    1. The emitted log triggers the Chainlink Automation upkeep.
    2. Chainlink Automation then uses `StreamsLookup` to retrieve a signed report from the Data Streams Aggregation Network, returns the data in a callback (`checkCallback`), and runs the `performUpkeep` function on your registered upkeep contract.
    2. Chainlink Automation then uses `StreamsLookup` to retrieve a signed report from the Data Streams Aggregation Network, returns the data in a callback (`checkCallback`), and runs the `performUpkeep` function on your registered upkeep contract.
    3. The `performUpkeep` function calls the `verify` function on the verifier contract to verify the report onchain.
    4. In this example, the `performUpkeep` function also stores the price from the report in the `last_retrieved_price` state variable and emits a `PriceUpdate` log message with the price.

### Viewing the retrieved price

The `last_retrieved_price` getter function of your upkeep contract retrieves the last price stored by the `performUpkeep` function in the `last_retrieved_price` state variable of the `StreamsUpkeep` contract. Additionally, the `performUpkeep` function emits a `PriceUpdate` log message with the retrieved price.

### Optional: Handle Data Streams fetching errors offchain with `checkErrorHandler`

When Automation detects the triggering event, it runs the `checkLog` function of your upkeep contract, which includes a `StreamsLookup` revert custom error. The `StreamsLookup` revert enables your upkeep to fetch a report from the Data Streams Aggregation Network. If the report is fetched successfully, the `checkCallback` function is evaluated offchain. Otherwise, the `checkErrorHandler` function is evaluated offchain to determine what Automation should do next.

In this example, the `checkErrorHandler` is set to always return `true` for `upkeepNeeded`. This implies that the upkeep is always triggered, even if the report fetching fails. You can modify the `checkErrorHandler` function to handle errors offchain in a way that works for your specific use case. Read more about [using the StreamsLookup error handler](/chainlink-automation/guides/streams-lookup-error-handler).
