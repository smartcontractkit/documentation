<Aside type="note" title="Optimize your development with the CCIP local simulator">
  Enhance your development workflow using the [Chainlink CCIP local
  simulator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local), an installable package designed to simulate Chainlink
  CCIP locally within your Hardhat and Foundry projects. It provides a robust smart contracts and scripts suite,
  enabling you to build, deploy, and execute CCIP token transfers and arbitrary messages on a local Hardhat or Anvil
  development node. With Chainlink Local, you can also work on forked nodes, ensuring a seamless transition of your
  contracts to test networks without modifications. Start integrating Chainlink Local today to streamline your
  development process and validate your CCIP implementations effectively.
