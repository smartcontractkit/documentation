<Aside type="note" title="Token Integration Process">
  If you are a token developer and wish to enable your token in CCIP, please submit your project details via this
  [contact form](https://chain.link/ccip-contact). When filling out the form, please select **Token admin registration**
  as the support request type. The Chainlink Labs team will work with you to enable your token for cross-chain
  interoperability. Tutorials for permissionless token enabling will be available soon.
