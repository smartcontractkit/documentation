<Aside type="note" title="Token Integration Process">
  If you are developing a token on Solana and wish to make it CCIP-compatible, please submit your project details via
  this [contact form](https://chain.link/ccip-contact). When filling out the form, please select **Token admin
  registration** as the support request type. The Chainlink Labs team will work with you to enable your token for
  cross-chain interoperability. Tutorials for permissionless token enabling will be available soon.
