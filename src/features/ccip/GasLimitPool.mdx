<Aside type="caution" title="Understand Token Pool Requirements">
  Before deploying your token pools, make sure you understand the mandatory requirements for token pools and the gas
  limit restrictions. The `releaseOrMint` function and other operations (e.g., balance checks) must not exceed the
  **90,000** gas limit on the destination blockchain. Failure to meet these requirements can lead to [manual
  execution](/ccip/concepts/manual-execution). For more details, refer to the [Requirements for Token
  Pools](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-tokens#requirements-for-token-pools).
