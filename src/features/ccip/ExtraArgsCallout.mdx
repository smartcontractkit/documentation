<Aside type="caution" title="Do not hardcode extraArgs">
  To simplify this example, `extraArgs` are hardcoded in the contract. For production deployments, make sure that
  `extraArgs` is mutable. This allows you to build it offchain and pass it in a call to a function or store it in a
  variable that you can update on-demand. This makes `extraArgs` compatible with future CCIP upgrades.
