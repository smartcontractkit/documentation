<Aside type="note" title="Gas price spikes">
    Under normal circumstances, transactions on the Ethereum Sepolia network require significantly fewer tokens to pay for gas. However, during exceptional periods of high gas price spikes, your transactions may fail if not sufficiently funded. In such cases, you may need to fund your contract with additional tokens. We recommend paying for your CCIP transactions in **LINK** tokens (rather than native tokens) as you can obtain extra LINK testnet tokens from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/). If you encounter a transaction failure due to these gas price spikes, please add additional LINK tokens to your contract and try again.
    Alternatively, you can use a supported testnet other than Sepolia.
