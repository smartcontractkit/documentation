<Aside type="caution" title="Sender Contract Best Practices">
This example is simplified for educational purposes. For production code, please adhere to the following best practices:

- **Do Not Hardcode `extraArgs`**: In this example, `extraArgs` are hardcoded within the contract for simplicity. It is recommended to make `extraArgs` mutable. For instance, you can construct `extraArgs` off-chain and pass them into your function calls, or store them in a storage variable that can be updated as needed. This approach ensures that `extraArgs` remain backward compatible with future CCIP upgrades. Refer to the [Best Practices](/ccip/concepts/best-practices/evm) guide for more information.

- **Validate the Destination Chain**: Always ensure that the destination chain is valid and supported before sending messages.

- **Understand `allowOutOfOrderExecution` Usage**: This example sets `allowOutOfOrderExecution` to `true` (see [GenericExtraArgsV2](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.6.0/client#genericextraargsv2)). Read the [Best Practices: Setting `allowOutOfOrderExecution`](/ccip/concepts/best-practices/evm#setting-allowoutoforderexecution) to learn more about this parameter.

Following these best practices ensures that your contract is robust, future-proof, and compliant with CCIP standards.
