<Aside type="note" title="CCIP-enabled Tokens">
  The **CCIP-enabled tokens** feature is currently available only on **testnet**. This feature allows projects to manage
  their tokens in CCIP, enabling them for cross-chain transactions. Projects can configure several parameters, such as
  token pool rate limits and determine which lanes their tokens are supported on.
