<Aside type="note" title="Cross-Chain Token (CCT)">
  The [**Cross-Chain Token** standard](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-tokens) is currently available only on blockchains
  where the [`TokenAdminRegistry`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry) and
  [`RegistryModuleOwnerCustom`](/ccip/api-reference/registry-module-owner-custom) contracts are deployed. This feature
  allows projects to enable their tokens in CCIP, enabling them for cross-chain transactions. Please see the [CCIP
  Directory](/ccip/directory) to verify if this feature is available for the blockchain you are working with.
