<Aside type="note" title="Cross Chain Tokens (CCT)">
  The **Cross Chain Tokens** feature is currently available only on lanes where the
  [`TokenAdminRegistry`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry) and
  [`RegistryModuleOwnerCustom`](/ccip/api-reference/registry-module-owner-custom) contracts are deployed. This feature
  allows projects to manage their tokens in CCIP, enabling them for cross-chain transactions. Projects can configure
  several parameters, such as token pool rate limits and determine which lanes their tokens are supported on. Please see
  the [Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks) page to verify if this feature is available for the blockchain you
  are working with.
