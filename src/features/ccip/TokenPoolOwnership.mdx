<Aside type="caution" title="Token Pool Ownership">

Self-Administered Token Pools are deployed and managed directly by token developers, and are not controlled by Chainlink Labs, the Chainlink Foundation, or Chainlink node operators. Such token pools exist outside of the CCIP protocol and must be evaluated by users on a case-by-case basis. Please review [CCIP Service Responsibility](/ccip/service-responsibility) for more information.
