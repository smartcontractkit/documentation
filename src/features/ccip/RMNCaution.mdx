<Aside type="caution" title="Risk Management Network Deployment Status">
  Certain blockchains may be integrated with CCIP in a phased approach, with the Committing and Executing DONs deployed
  first and the Risk Management Network added in a later update. In cases of a phased deployment, Merkle roots in
  relevant Commit Stores are always considered blessed, until the Risk Management Network has been deployed for that
  blockchain. Please see [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) to see which integrations utilize a phased approach. Please
  review [CCIP Service Responsibility](/ccip/service-responsibility) for more information.
