<Aside type="caution" title="Risk Management Network Deployment Status">
  Certain CCIP integrations do not include the Risk Management Network (RMN). A blockchain may be integrated with CCIP
  in a phased approach, with the Committing and Executing DONs deployed first and the Risk Management Network added in a
  later update. In cases of a phased deployment, relevant Commit Stores are configured in the Risk Management contract
  to always be considered blessed, until the Risk Management Network has been deployed for that blockchain. Please see
  [Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks) to see which integrations utilize a phased approach. Please review
  [CCIP Service Responsibility](/ccip/service-responsibility) for more information.
