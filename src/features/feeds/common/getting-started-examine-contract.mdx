## Examine the sample contract

This example contract obtains the latest price answer from the [BTC / USD feed](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) on the Sepolia testnet, but you can modify it to read any of the different [Types of Data Feeds](/data-feeds#types-of-data-feeds).

<CodeSample src="samples/DataFeeds/DataConsumerV3.sol" />

The contract has the following components:

- The `import` line imports an interface named `AggregatorV3Interface`. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves. In this case, `AggregatorV3Interface` defines that all v3 Aggregators have the function `latestRoundData`. You can [see the complete code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) for the `AggregatorV3Interface` on GitHub.

- The `constructor() {}` initializes an interface object named `dataFeed` that uses `AggregatorV3Interface` and connects specifically to a proxy aggregator contract that is already deployed at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`. The interface allows your contract to run functions on that deployed aggregator contract.

- The `getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer()` function calls your `dataFeed` object and runs the `latestRoundData()` function. When you deploy the contract, it initializes the `dataFeed` object to point to the aggregator at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`, which is the proxy address for the Sepolia BTC / USD data feed. Your contract connects to that address and executes the function. The aggregator connects with several oracle nodes and aggregates the pricing data from those nodes. The response from the aggregator includes several variables, but `getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer()` returns only the `answer` variable.
