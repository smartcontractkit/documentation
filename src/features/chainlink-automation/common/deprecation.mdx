<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation of older upkeeps">
  The only supported Automation registries are v2.1 and later. [Migrate your older
  upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/guides/migrate-to-v2) if you need them to be performed. Unmigrated upkeeps on
  registries earlier than v2.1 will not be performed anymore, and you will see a "deprecated" notice in the [Chainlink
  Automation App](https://automation.chain.link).
