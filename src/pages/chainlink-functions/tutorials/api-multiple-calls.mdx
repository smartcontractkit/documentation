This tutorial shows you how make multiple API calls from your smart contract to a Decentralized Oracle Network. After [OCR](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) completes off-chain computation and aggregation, the DON returns the asset price to your smart contract. This example returns the `BTC/USD` price.

This guide assumes that you know how to build HTTP requests and how to use secrets. Read the [API query parameters](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-query-parameters) and [API use secrets](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-use-secrets) guides before you follow the example in this document.
To build a decentralized asset price, send a request to the DON to fetch the price from many different API providers. Then, calculate the median price. The API providers in this example are:

- [CoinMarket](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/)
- [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)
- [CoinPaprika](https://api.coinpaprika.com/)

<Aside type="caution">
  Chainlink Functions is still in BETA. Please utilize credentials that are assigned for your testing purposes only and
  that do not secure sensitive data or real value. The use of secrets in your requests is an experimental feature that
  may not operate as expected and is subject to change. Use of this feature is at your own risk and may result in
  unexpected errors, possible revealing of the secret as new versions are released, or other issues.

<Aside type="note" title="Request Access">
  Chainlink Functions is currently in a limited BETA. Apply [here](http://functions.chain.link/) to add your EVM account
  address to the Allow List.
</Aside>

1. **[Complete the setup steps in the Getting Started guide](/chainlink-functions/getting-started):** The Getting Started Guide shows you how to set up your environment with the necessary tools for these tutorials. You can re-use the same consumer contract for each of these tutorials.

1. Make sure your subscription has enough LINK to pay for your requests. Read [Get Subscription details](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#get-subscription-details) to learn how to check your subscription balance. If your subscription runs out of LINK, follow the [Fund a Subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) guide.

1. **Check out the correct branch before you try this tutorial:** Each tutorial is stored in a separate branch of the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) repository.

   ```bash
   git checkout tutorial-6
   ```

1. Get a free API key from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) and note your API key.

1. The starter kit stores encrypted secrets as [gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) to share them off-chain with the Decentralized Oracle Network. To allow the starter kit to write gists on your behalf, create a [github fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).

   1. Visit [Github tokens settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
   1. Click on _Generate new token_.
   1. Provide a name to your token and define the expiration date.
   1. Under `Account permissions`, enable _Read and write_ for Gists. **Note**: Do not enable additional settings.
   1. Click on _Generate token_ and copy your fine-grained personal access token.

1. Run `npx env-enc set` to add an encrypted `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` and `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` to your `.env.enc` file.

   ```shell
   npx env-enc set
   ```

## Tutorial

<Aside type="note" title="Set up your environment variables">
  This tutorial has some unique `.env.enc` setup steps. Make sure that you configured your `.env.enc` file with the
  necessary variables in the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section.
</Aside>

This tutorial is configured to get the median `BTC/USD` price from multiple data sources. For a detailed explanation of the code example, read the [Explanation](#explanation) section.

- Open `Functions-request-config.js`. Note the `args` value is `["1", "bitcoin", "btc-bitcoin"]`. These arguments are BTC IDs at CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Coinpaprika. You can adapt `args` to fetch other asset prices. See the API docs for [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation), and [CoinPaprika](https://api.coinpaprika.com/) for details. For more information about the request, read the [request config](#functions-request-configjs) section.
- Open `Functions-request-source.js` to analyze the JavaScript source code. Read the [source code explanation](#functions-request-sourcejs) for a more detailed explanation of the request source file.

### Simulation

The [Chainlink Functions Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) includes a simulator to test your Functions code on your local machine. The `functions-simulate` command executes your code in a local runtime environment and simulates an end-to-end fulfillment. This helps you to fix issues before you submit functions to the Decentralized Oracle Network.

Run the `functions-simulate` task to run the source code locally and make sure `Functions-request-config.js` and `Functions-request-source.js` are correctly written:

```bash
npx hardhat functions-simulate
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-simulate

Reading the output of the example above, you can note that the `BTC/USD` median price is: _28354.00 USD_. Because Solidity does not support decimals, we move the decimal point so that the value looks like the integer `2835400` before returning the `bytes` encoded value `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002b43c8` in the callback. Read the [source code explanation](#functions-request-sourcejs) for a more detailed explanation.

### Request

<Aside type="note" title="Reminder">
  Before you can make a successful request, you must complete the setup steps in the [Before you
  begin](#before-you-begin) section. Each tutorial is in a separate Git branch and some require unique entries in your
  `.env.enc` file.
</Aside>

Send a request to the Decentralized Oracle Network to fetch the asset price. Run the `functions-request` task with the `subid` (subscription ID) and `contract` parameters. This task passes the functions JavaScript source code and any arguments and secrets when calling the `executeRequest` function in your deployed `FunctionsConsumer` contract. Read the [functionsConsumer](#functionsconsumersol) section for a more detailed explanation about the consumer contract.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-request --subid REPLACE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-request --subid 443 --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea --network polygonMumbai

```

The output of the example above gives you the following information:

- The `executeRequest` function was successfully called in the `FunctionsConsumer` contract. The transaction in this example is [0x4efe45aa9a21dd33e34a62af879275579a06ab34910abb7676de07991bb8c223](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x4efe45aa9a21dd33e34a62af879275579a06ab34910abb7676de07991bb8c223).
- The request ID is `0x80d692db8ae330e9e014b44bb5e41f239af543084f099225846d9cb732c3daae`.
- The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.200092593367121997 LINK`.
- The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002b4170`. Decoding the response off-chain to `uint256` gives you a result of `2834800`.
- The starter kit created a gist `https://gist.github.com/aelmanaa/482d4308b57cf9f39ed1e24efaae0a4f` containing the encrypted secrets. This gist is shared with the DON when making the request.
- After request fulfillment, the starter kit deleted the gist `https://gist.github.com/aelmanaa/482d4308b57cf9f39ed1e24efaae0a4f`.

At any time, you can run the `functions-read` task with the `contract` parameter to read the latest received response.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-read  --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-read  --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea  --network polygonMumbai

## Explanation

### FunctionsConsumer.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### Functions-request-config.js

Read the [Request Configuration](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) section for a detailed description of each setting. In this example, the settings are the following:

- `codeLocation: Location.Inline`: The JavaScript code is provided within the request.
- `codeLanguage: CodeLanguage.JavaScript`: The source code is developed in the JavaScript language.
- `source: fs.readFileSync("./Functions-request-source.js").toString()`: The source code must be a script object. This example uses `fs.readFileSync` to read `Functions-request-source.js` and calls `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
- `secrets: { apiKey: process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY }`: JavaScript object which contains secret values. Before making the request, these secrets are encrypted using the DON public key. The `process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` setting means `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` is fetched from the environment variables. **Note**: `secrets` is limited to a key-value map that can only contain strings. It cannot include any other types or nested parameters.
- `walletPrivateKey: process.env["PRIVATE_KEY"]`: This is your EVM account private key. It is used to generate a signature for the encrypted secrets such that an unauthorized third party cannot reuse them.
- `args: ["1", "bitcoin", "btc-bitcoin"]`: These arguments are passed to the source code. This example requests the `BTC/USD` price. These arguments are BTC IDs at CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Coinpaprika. You can adapt `args` to fetch other asset prices. See the API docs for [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation), and [CoinPaprika](https://api.coinpaprika.com/) for details.
- `expectedReturnType: ReturnType.uint256`: The response received by the DON is encoded in `bytes`. Because the asset price is `uint256`, you must define `ReturnType.uint256` to inform users how to decode the response received by the DON.

### Functions-request-source.js

To check the expected API responses, run these commands in your terminal:

- CoinMarketCap:
  ```bash
  curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest?id=1&convert=USD' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY: REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY'
  ```
- CoinGecko:

  ```bash
  curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?vs_currencies=USD&ids=bitcoin' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```

- Coinpaprika:

  ```bash
  curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/btc-bitcoin' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```

The price is located at:

- CoinMarketCap: `data,1,quote,USD,price`
- CoinGecko: `bitcoin,usd`
- Coinpaprika: `quotes,USD,price`

Read the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#javascript-code) section for a detailed explanation of how to write a compatible JavaScript source code. This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) to make HTTP requests.

The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps. The main steps are:

- Construct the HTTP objects `coinMarketCapRequest`, `coinGeckoRequest`, and `coinPaprikaRequest` using `Functions.makeHttpRequest`. The values for `coinMarketCapCoinId`, `coinGeckoCoinId`, and `coinPaprikaCoinId` are fetched from the `args`. See the [request config](#functions-request-configjs) section for details.
- Make the HTTP calls.
- Read the asset price from each response.
- Calculate the median of all the prices.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.encodeUint256` helper function. Because solidity doesn't support decimals, multiply the result by `100` and round the result to the nearest integer. **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.
