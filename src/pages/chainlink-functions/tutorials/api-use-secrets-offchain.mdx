As explained in the [Using Secrets in Requests guide](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-use-secrets), the Chainlink Functions starter kit shares encrypted secrets off-chain with a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) using [gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists). This tutorial shows you how to share encrypted secrets off-chain with a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) using another storage platform such as AWS S3, Google Drive, IPFS, or any other service where the DON can fetch secrets via HTTP.

Read the [API multiple calls](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-multiple-calls) tutorial before you follow the steps in this example. This tutorial uses the same example, but with a slightly different process:

1. Instead of relying on the default off-chain option(gists), you will host your encrypted secrets on AWS S3.
1. Include the encrypted secrets in an `offchain-secrets.json` file.
1. Host the secrets file off-chain (AWS S3).
1. Include the HTTP URL to the file in your Chainlink Functions request.

The `functions-build-offchain-secrets` task encrypts the secrets and creates the secrets file for you. For reference, you can find the public key for the DON by running the `getDONPublicKey` function on the [Functions Oracle Proxy contract](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xeA6721aC65BCeD841B8ec3fc5fEdeA6141a0aDE4#readProxyContract#F5). See the [Supported Networks](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/supported-networks#contract-addresses) page to find the Functions Oracle Proxy contract for each supported network.

<Aside type="caution">
  Chainlink Functions is still in BETA. Please utilize credentials that are assigned for your testing purposes only and
  that do not secure sensitive data or real value. The use of secrets in your requests is an experimental feature that
  may not operate as expected and is subject to change. Use of this feature is at your own risk and may result in
  unexpected errors, possible revealing of the secret as new versions are released, or other issues.

1. **[Complete the setup steps in the Getting Started guide](/chainlink-functions/getting-started):** The Getting Started Guide shows you how to set up your environment with the necessary tools for these tutorials. You can re-use the same consumer contract for each of these tutorials.

1. Make sure to understand the [API multiple calls](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-multiple-calls) guide.

1. Make sure your subscription has enough LINK to pay for your requests. Read [Get Subscription details](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#get-subscription-details) to learn how to check your subscription balance. If your subscription runs out of LINK, follow the [Fund a Subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) guide.

1. **Check out the correct branch before you try this tutorial:** Each tutorial is stored in a separate branch of the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) repository.

   ```bash
   git checkout tutorial-7
   ```

1. Get a free API key from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).
1. Run `npx env-enc set` to add an encrypted `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` to your `.env.enc` file.

   ```shell
   npx env-enc set
   ```

1. Prepare the store for your encrypted secrets file.
   1. Create a [AWS free tier account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
   1. Follow [these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html) to create a AWS S3 bucket. Choose a name for your bucket, set _ACLs enabled_, and turn off _Block all public access_.

## Tutorial

<Aside type="note" title="Set up your environment variables">
  This tutorial has some unique `.env.enc` setup steps. Make sure that you configured your `.env.enc` file with the
  necessary variables in the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section.
</Aside>

This tutorial is configured to get the median `BTC/USD` price from multiple data sources. For a detailed explanation of the code example, read the [Explanation](#explanation) section.

- Open `Functions-request-config.js`. Note the `args` value is `["1", "bitcoin", "btc-bitcoin"]`. These arguments are BTC IDs at CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Coinpaprika. You can adapt `args` to fetch other asset prices. See the API docs for [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation), and [CoinPaprika](https://api.coinpaprika.com/) for details. For more information about the request, read the [request config](#functions-request-configjs) section.
- Open `Functions-request-source.js` to analyze the JavaScript source code. Read the [source code explanation](#functions-request-sourcejs) for a more detailed explanation of the request source file.

### Build Off-chain Secrets

Before you make a request, prepare the secrets file and host it off-chain:

1. Encrypt the secrets with the public key of the DON and store them in the `offchain-secrets.json` file. The `--network` flag is required because each network has a unique DON with a different public key.

   ```bash
   npx hardhat functions-build-offchain-secrets --network REPLACE_NETWORK
   ```

   Example:

   ```text
   $ npx hardhat functions-build-offchain-secrets --network polygonMumbai
   secp256k1 unavailable, reverting to browser version
   Using public keys from FunctionsOracle contract 0xeA6721aC65BCeD841B8ec3fc5fEdeA6141a0aDE4 on network mumbai

   Wrote offchain secrets file to offchain-secrets.json
   ```

1. Follow these [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/uploading-an-object-bucket.html) to upload the file `offchain-secrets.json` to your AWS S3 bucket.

1. To make the file publically accessible without authentication:

   1. Find the file in the bucket list, and click on it to open the object overview.
   1. Click on the _Permissions_ tab to display the _Access control list (ACL)_.
   1. Click on _Edit_.
   1. Set _Everyone (public access)_ Objects read, then confirm. This action makes the object readable by anyone on the internet.
   1. Note the object URL.
   1. To verify that the URL is publicly readable without authentication, open a new browser tab and copy/paste the object URL in the browser location bar. After you hit _Enter_ , the browser will display the content of your encrypted secrets file.

1. Open `Functions-request-config.js`. Fill in the `secretsURLs` variable. For example: `secretsURLs: ["https://clfunctions.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/offchain-secrets.json"]`. **Note**: When you make requests, any URLs in `secretsURL` are encrypted so no third party can view them.

### Simulation

The [Chainlink Functions Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) includes a simulator to test your Functions code on your local machine. The `functions-simulate` command executes your code in a local runtime environment and simulates an end-to-end fulfillment. This helps you to fix issues before you submit functions to the Decentralized Oracle Network.

Run the `functions-simulate` task to run the source code locally and make sure `Functions-request-config.js` and `Functions-request-source.js` are correctly written:

```bash
npx hardhat functions-simulate
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-simulate

Reading the output of the example above, you can note that the `BTC/USD` median price is: _28148.36 USD_. Because Solidity does not support decimals, we move the decimal point so that the value looks like the integer `2814836` before returning the `bytes` encoded value `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002af374` in the callback. Read the [source code explanation](#functions-request-sourcejs) for a more detailed explanation.

### Request

<Aside type="note" title="Reminder">
  Before you can make a successful request, you must complete the setup steps in the [Before you
  begin](#before-you-begin) section. Each tutorial is in a separate Git branch and some require unique entries in your
  `.env.enc` file.
</Aside>

Send a request to the Decentralized Oracle Network to fetch the asset price. Run the `functions-request` task with the `subid` (subscription ID) and `contract` parameters. This task passes the functions JavaScript source code and any arguments and secrets when calling the `executeRequest` function in your deployed `FunctionsConsumer` contract. Read the [functionsConsumer](#functionsconsumersol) section for a more detailed explanation about the consumer contract.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-request --subid REPLACE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK
```

Example (You will see several compile warnings, but no errors):

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-request --subid 443 --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea --network polygonMumbai

## Explanation

### FunctionsConsumer.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### Functions-request-config.js

Read the [Request Configuration](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) section for a detailed description of each setting. In this example, the settings are the following:

- `codeLocation: Location.Inline`: The JavaScript code is provided within the request.
- `codeLanguage: CodeLanguage.JavaScript`: The source code is developed in the JavaScript language.
- `source: fs.readFileSync("./Functions-request-source.js").toString()`: The source code must be a script object. This example uses `fs.readFileSync` to read `Functions-request-source.js` and calls `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
- `secrets: { apiKey: process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY }`: JavaScript object which contains secret values. These secrets are encrypted using the DON public key. The `process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` setting means `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` is fetched from the environment variables. **Note**: `secrets` is limited to a key-value map that can only contain strings. It cannot include any other types or nested parameters.
- `secretsURLs: ["YOUR_HTTP_URL"]`: This is an array that contains the URLs of encrypted secrets.
- `walletPrivateKey: process.env["PRIVATE_KEY"]`: This is your EVM account private key. It is used to generate a signature for the encrypted secrets such that an unauthorized third party cannot reuse them.
- `args: ["1", "bitcoin", "btc-bitcoin"]`: These arguments are passed to the source code. This example requests the `BTC/USD` price. These arguments are BTC IDs at CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Coinpaprika. You can adapt `args` to fetch other asset prices. See the API docs for [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation), and [CoinPaprika](https://api.coinpaprika.com/) for details.
- `expectedReturnType: ReturnType.uint256`: The response received by the DON is encoded in `bytes`. Because the asset price is `uint256`, you must define `ReturnType.uint256` to inform users how to decode the response received by the DON.

### Functions-request-source.js

To check the expected API responses, run these commands in your terminal:

- CoinMarketCap:
  ```bash
  curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest?id=1&convert=USD' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY: REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY'
  ```
- CoinGecko:

  ```bash
  curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?vs_currencies=USD&ids=bitcoin' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```

- Coinpaprika:

  ```bash
  curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/btc-bitcoin' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```

The price is located at:

- CoinMarketCap: `data,1,quote,USD,price`
- CoinGecko: `bitcoin,usd`
- Coinpaprika: `quotes,USD,price`

Read the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#javascript-code) section for a detailed explanation of how to write a compatible JavaScript source code. This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) to make HTTP requests.

The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps. The main steps are:

- Construct the HTTP objects `coinMarketCapRequest`, `coinGeckoRequest`, and `coinPaprikaRequest` using `Functions.makeHttpRequest`. The values for `coinMarketCapCoinId`, `coinGeckoCoinId`, and `coinPaprikaCoinId` are fetched from the `args`. See the [request config](#functions-request-configjs) section for details.
- Make the HTTP calls.
- Read the asset price from each response.
- Calculate the median of all the prices.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.encodeUint256` helper function. Because solidity doesn't support decimals, multiply the result by `100` and round the result to the nearest integer. **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.
