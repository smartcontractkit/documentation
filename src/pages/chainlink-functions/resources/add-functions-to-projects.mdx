The [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) lets you run several example requests, but extra steps are required to add Chainlink Functions to your existing projects.

If you are new to Chainlink Functions, complete the steps in the [Getting Started Guide](/chainlink-functions/getting-started) to learn the basics. If you already have a project, you can skip to the [Libraries and Dependencies](#get-the-dependency-contracts-and-scripts) section.

Using Chainlink Functions to your existing projects requires the following components:

- **A consumer contract:** Use this contract to send requests to the Chainlink Functions decentralized oracle network (DON). The consumer contract imports the following dependencies:
  - [FunctionsClient.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/dev/functions/FunctionsClient.sol): This includes several functions necessary to submit requests to the DON.
  - [ConfirmedOwner.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/ConfirmedOwner.sol) from the [@chainlink/contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts) NPM package.
- **A Chainlink Functions subscription:** The subscription is used to pay for Chainlink Functions requests when they are fulfilled. You can [create and fund](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions) subscriptions using the starter kit tools, but this guide shows you how to manage subscriptions programmatically.

## Before you begin

This guide assumes you are using a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) JavaScript project with Node.js, but you can modify it to work with other frameworks. If you already have a project, you can skip to the [Libraries and Dependencies](#get-the-dependency-contracts-and-scripts) section.

You must have a wallet with testnet LINK and native tokens to run this example. This example uses Polygon Mumbai, but you can use any of the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks). You can get testnet LINK at [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai) and testnet MATIC at the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/). To learn how to get testnet funds for other networks, see the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=chainlinkFunctions) page.

### Configure Hardhat

If you don't already have a Hardhat project, start one with the following steps:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). **Note**: Node.js version 18 is required.
1. Make a new project directory:

   ```shell
   mkdir new-functions-project && cd new-functions-project
   ```

1. Create a new Node.js project:

   ```shell
   npm init
   ```

1. Install Hardhat as a dev dependency:

   ```shell
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```

1. Install the dependency packages:

   ```shell
   npm install @chainlink/contracts @chainlink/env-enc @openzeppelin/contracts @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable eth-crypto dotenv axios vm2 is-http-url prompt-sync
   ```

1. Create a new Hardhat project. For this example, create a JavaScript project and use the default configurations:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat
   ```

1. Remove the `Lock.sol` contract that Hardhat creates by default. This contract is not necessary to compile it for this tutorial.

   ```shell
   rm ./contracts/Lock.sol
   ```

Modify `hardhat.config.js` to include the `0.8.7` compiler version and supported networks. See the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page for a list of networks where Chainlink Functions DONs are available. This example uses Polygon Mumbai by default:

<CodeSample src="samples/Functions/adding-functions-to-projects/hardhat.config.js" />

1.  For higher security, you should encrypt your environment variables at rest.

            1.  Set an encryption password for your environment variables.

                  ```shell
                  npx env-enc set-pw
                  ```

            1.  Run `npx env-enc set` to configure a `.env.enc` file with the basic variables that you need to send your requests to the Polygon Mumbai network.

                  - `POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL`: Set a URL for the Polygon Mumbai testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

                  - `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: Set a URL for the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

                  - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Find the private key for your testnet wallet. If you use MetaMask, follow the instructions to [Export a Private Key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key). Set this in the `.env` file. **Note**: The Chainlink Functions hardhat starter kit uses your private key to sign any transactions you make such as deploying your consumer contract, creating subscriptions, and making requests.

                  ```shell
                  npx env-enc set
                  ```

Run the compile command for Hardhat or your framework of choice to make sure everything is configured correctly. You will see several compile warnings, but everything is correct if the Solidity files compile successfully. For this example, you can run `npx hardhat compile`.

## Get the dependency contracts and scripts

Get the required libraries from the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit). You can clone the repo and copy the folders into your existing project manually, or use a single command to get a tarball through the GitHub API and extract the folders you need to the correct location in your project.

1. Open a terminal and change directories to the root of your project. Usually this is the folder with `package.json`.

1. Run the `curl` command to download the latest tarball from the starter kit `main` branch and then run `tar -xf` with the `--strip` flag to extract only the files you need. The following command combines both steps:

   {/* prettier-ignore */}
   <Tabs client:visible>
      <Fragment slot="tab.1">MacOS</Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="tab.2">Linux</Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="panel.1">
      ```shell MacOS
      curl -L -o ../functions.tar.gz https://api.github.com/repos/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/tarball/main &&
      tar -xf ../functions.tar.gz --strip=1 -T <(echo -e "smartcontractkit-functions-hardhat-starter-kit-*/contracts/dev\nsmartcontractkit-functions-hardhat-starter-kit-*/contracts/test\nsmartcontractkit-functions-hardhat-starter-kit-*/FunctionsSandboxLibrary\nsmartcontractkit-functions-hardhat-starter-kit-*/contracts/FunctionsConsumer.sol")
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="panel.2">
      ```shell Linux
      curl -L -o ../functions.tar.gz https://api.github.com/repos/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/tarball/main &&
      tar -xf ../functions.tar.gz --strip=1 --wildcards smartcontractkit-functions-hardhat-starter-kit-*/contracts/dev smartcontractkit-functions-hardhat-starter-kit-*/contracts/test smartcontractkit-functions-hardhat-starter-kit-*/FunctionsSandboxLibrary smartcontractkit-functions-hardhat-starter-kit-*/contracts/FunctionsConsumer.sol
      ```
      </Fragment>
   </Tabs>

When you are done, you should have the necessary dependencies in the following directories:

- `contracts/dev`
- `contracts/test`
- `FunctionsSandboxLibrary`

Run the compile command to make sure all the dependencies are satisfied. Add missing dependencies or Hardhat configuration options as necessary. For Hardhat, run `npx hardhat compile`.

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

## Configure on-chain resources

The on-chain resources are critical for Chainlink Functions to process your requests.

1. [Create a consumer contract](#create-a-consumer-contract)
1. [Deploy a consumer contract](#deploy-a-consumer-contract)

### Create a consumer contract

Use the [FunctionsConsumer.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/FunctionsConsumer.sol), which is already in your `./contracts` folder. You can modify it to fit your needs and redeploy it later. Optionally, you can take an existing contract of your own and enable it to handle Chainlink Functions requests. Just make sure that it meets the requirements listed in this guide.

In general, a consumer contract requires several components:

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

Next, deploy the contract.

### Deploy a consumer contract

You can deploy consumer contracts using the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit), but this example shows how to deploy the contract programmatically using a script.

1. Create a script named `deploy.js` in the `./scripts` folder of your project:

   ```shell
   touch ./scripts/deploy.js && open ./scripts/deploy.js
   ```

1. Copy the following code into the script.

   <CodeSample src="samples/Functions/adding-functions-to-projects/deploy.js" />

1. Set the `oracleAddress` to the oracle address on the network that you want to use. Each network has a unique DON with a unique oracle address. See the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page for a list of supported networks and oracle addresses. For this example, use the address for the oracle on Polygon Mumbai:

   ```javascript
   const oracleAddress = "0xeA6721aC65BCeD841B8ec3fc5fEdeA6141a0aDE4"
   ```

1. Set `const contractName` to the name of the contract that you want Hardhat to deploy. The `ethers.getContractFactory(contractName);` line creates a `ContractFactory` object using the contract that you define. For this example, use `FunctionsConsumer`.

   ```javascript
   const contractName = "FunctionsConsumer"

   ⋮

   const consumerContract = await ethers.getContractFactory(contractName);
   ```

1. Save the file and run the script to deploy your contract. Include the `--network` flag to use a network other than the default in the Hardhat config:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network your_network
   ```

1. If your contract deployed successfully, you will see the deployed consumer address. Record this address to use later:

   ```text
   Deployed Functions Consumer address: 0xE83188aDF26bd6c18076704fC8EC68CBda454f76
   ```

Next, create and fund your Chainlink Functions subscription.

### Create and fund a subscription

You can use the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) to create and manage your subscriptions. See [Managing Subscriptions](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions) for instructions.

This example shows how to create and manage subscriptions programmatically. You can create the subscription, fund the subscription, and authorize the consumer all in one script. If you have not already signed up for limited Beta access to Chainlink Functions, apply [here](http://functions.chain.link/) to add your EVM account address to the Allow List.

1. Ensure that the wallet address you are using to create the subscription has a sufficient LINK balance. You can get testnet LINK at [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai). To get testnet funds for other networks, see the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=chainlinkFunctions) page.

1. Create a script named `functions-sub.js` in the `./scripts` folder of your project:

   ```shell
   touch ./scripts/functions-sub.js && open ./scripts/functions-sub.js
   ```

1. Copy the following code into the script:

   <CodeSample src="samples/Functions/adding-functions-to-projects/functions-sub.js" />

1. Set `const linkAmount` with the amount of LINK you want to send to the subscription. You can retrieve extra funds later when you cancel the subscription.

   ```javascript
   const linkAmount = "1"
   ```

1. Set `const consumer` to the address of the consumer contract that you deployed:

   ```javascript
   const consumer = "0xE83188aDF26bd6c18076704fC8EC68CBda454f76"
   ```

1. Save the file and run the script. Include the `--network` flag to use a network other than the default in the Hardhat config:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat run scripts/functions-sub.js --network your_network
   ```

1. If the script is successful, you the terminal prints your subscription ID. Record this ID to use for Chainlink Functions requests. You should see output similar to the following example:

   ```text
   Subscription created with ID: 1337
   Duplicate definition of Transfer (Transfer(address,address,uint256,bytes), Transfer(address,address,uint256))
   Funding with 1000000000000000000 LINK
   Subscription 1337 funded with 1000000000000000000 LINK
   Adding consumer contract address 0xE83188aDF26bd6c18076704fC8EC68CBda454f76 to subscription 1337
   Authorized consumer contract: 0xE83188aDF26bd6c18076704fC8EC68CBda454f76
   ```

Now that the consumer contract is deployed and the subscription is created and funded with LINK, the on-chain resources are ready to handle your requests. Next, create JavaScript code that you want to run on the DON, configure arguments for the code, and create a script to send your request.

## Send requests

After your on-chain resources are configured, you can send Chainlink Functions requests to the DON. This can be done from a Web3 application, script, another on-chain smart contract, or any other location capable of submitting requests to your consumer contract. This example shows you how to generate a request, encrypt secrets, send your request, and read the fulfillment response.

Each request has the following components:

- **Source code:** JavaScript code that will run on the DON.
- **Arguments:** Optional arguments for the source code. The arguments that you need are defined in your source code. Depending on how you configured your source, you might not need any arguments at all.
- **Secrets:** Optional secrets that your source code needs to access APIs or other interfaces. See the [Using Secrets in Requests](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-use-secrets) and [Using Off-chain Secrets](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-use-secrets-offchain) tutorials for examples.

### Create a request script

If you already have source code or want to write your own source code, put it in a file in your project. Later, you can specify the path to this file before you submit your request.

For this example, download some example source code and create a script to assemble the required components. The script will read your source code, define arguments, encrypt secrets, and send requests to your consumer contract. This example script does not require Hardhat, so you can modify it to run in a browser using Ethers or another framework.

1. Use `curl` to get the example source code. This code runs on each node in the DON and returns a response to your consumer contract. For this example, use the source from the [Call an API](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-query-parameters) tutorial. The following `curl` request creates a file named `Functions-request-source.js` with the source code:

   ```shell
   curl -o Functions-request-source.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/main/add-functions-to-project/Functions-request-source.js
   ```

1. Get the example script and put it in the `./scripts` directory:

   ```shell
   curl -o ./scripts/request.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/main/add-functions-to-project/scripts/request.js
   ```

1. Edit the script and set your deployed consumer address in `const consumerAddress`:

   ```javascript
   const consumerAddress = 0xe83188adf26bd6c18076704fc8ec68cbda454f76
   ```

1. Set `const subscriptionId` to your Chainlink Functions subscription ID. This must be the same ID that your consumer contract is authorized to use. You can [add a consumer contract to a subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#add-a-consumer-contract-to-a-subscription) later if you need to.

   ```javascript
   const subscriptionId = 1337
   ```

1. Set `const consumerAbiPath` to the ABI file that you created when you ran `npx hardhat compile`. The ABI tells Ethers how to interact with your deployed contract. If you compiled and deployed `FunctionsConsumer.sol`, set a path like the following example:

   ```javascript
   const consumerAbiPath = "./artifacts/contracts/FunctionsConsumer.sol/FunctionsConsumer.json"
   ```

1. Set `const source` with the path to the request source code that you downloaded earlier:

   ```javascript
   const source = ./Functions-request-source.js
   ```

1. Set `const args` with an array of arguments for the DON to use when it runs your source. If you look at the `Functions-request-source.js` file, you can see that it requires two arguments. The args define which assets to retrieve from the data source URL.

   ```javascript
   const args = ["ETH", "USD"]
   ```

1. Set `const oracleAddress` to the oracle address on the network that you want to use. Each network has a unique DON with a unique oracle address. See the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page for a list of supported networks and oracle addresses. For this example, use the address for the oracle on Polygon Mumbai:

   ```javascript
   const oracleAddress = "0xeA6721aC65BCeD841B8ec3fc5fEdeA6141a0aDE4"
   ```

1. Set `const oracleAbiPath` to the ABI for the oracle contract. If you downloaded and compiled the dependencies for deploying your consumer contract, the oracle ABI is already generated in `./artifacts/contracts/dev/functions/`:

   ```javascript
   const oracleAbiPath = "./artifacts/contracts/dev/functions/FunctionsOracle.sol/FunctionsOracle.json"
   ```

1. Secrets are not required for this example.

1. Save and close the script.

1. Run the script to send the request to the DON.

   ```shell
   npx hardhat run scripts/request.js --network your_network
   ```

If the script runs successfully, the script reads your consumer contract and prints the stored value that the DON returned.

```text
Waiting for fulfillment...

Stored value is: 164144
```

Now you have the tools you need to build your own applications that use Chainlink Functions. Modify `Functions-request-source.js` and your input arguments to try out different capabilities. For more examples, see the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) section.
