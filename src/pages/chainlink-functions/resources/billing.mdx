## Concepts

For _Chainlink Functions_ to fulfill your requests, you must maintain a sufficient amount of LINK in your _subscription balance_. Because _Chainlink Functions_ follows the [Request and Receive Data](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) model, billing is also done in two steps:

1. During the _Request_ step. the cost to fulfill a Chainlink Functions request is **estimated** and blocked on the _Subscription balance_ by adding it to the _Subscription reservation_.
1. During the _Receive_ step, the exact cost of the fulfillment is **calculated** and billed to the _Subscription account_.

You can break down total costs into the following components:

- Gas cost: This cost is paid back to the _Transmitter oracle_ for fulfilling the request.
- Fees:
  - DON fees: These fees are paid to the _DON_ in LINK to compensate the nodes for their work.
  - Registry fees: These fees are paid in LINK for the maintenance of the _Subscriptions Contract_.

Gas cost calculation includes the following variables:

- Gas price: The current gas price fluctuates depending on network conditions.
- Callback gas: The amount of gas used for the callback request. See the [Cost Calculation](#cost-calculation-fulfillment) section.
- Estimated gas overhead: The amount of gas used by the _Subscriptions contract_ and _Functions Oracle contract_. It is an estimate of the total gas cost of fulfilling a request. See the [Cost Simulation](#cost-simulation-reservation) section.
- Gas Report: The exact amount of gas used by the _Functions Oracle contract_ when fulfilling a request. See the [Cost Calculation](#cost-calculation-fulfillment) section.
- Gas after payment: The amount of gas used to cover additional operations such as decrementing the subscription balance and incrementing the oracle's withdrawable balance.
- Callback gas limit: This specifies the maximum amount of gas to spend for a client callback. It is an estimate of the total gas cost to fulfil a request. See the [Cost Simulation](#cost-simulation-reservation) section.
- Native to LINK conversion: This allows your subscription balance to be billed only in LINK tokens.
  - Convert the network's native currency to LINK: The total gas cost in _native_ units is converted to LINK using the correct [Price Feed](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses). On Sepolia, the conversion uses the ETH/LINK Price Feed. On Polygon Mumbai, the conversion uses the MATIC/LINK Price Feed.
  - Fallback Wei to LINK ratio: In the unlikely event that the _Native to LINK_ price data feed is unavailable, the fallback conversion is used. You can find this ratio by running the `gitConfig` function in the Oracle Registry proxy contract. See the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page to find the contract addresses for each network.

## Cost Simulation (Reservation)

During the _Request_ step:

- The total cost in LINK is **estimated** using the following formula:

  ```
  (Gas price * (Estimated gas overhead + Callback gas limit + Gas after payment)) / Native to Link conversion = total estimated gas cost in LINK

  total estimated cost in LINK = total gas cost + DON fees + Registry fees
  ```

- The total estimated cost is then added to the _Subscription reservation_.

## Cost Calculation (Fulfillment)

When a DON's oracle reports the response, subscription accounts are charged based on the gas amount used in the callback:

- The total cost in LINK is **calculated** using the following formula:

  ```
  (Gas price * (Gas Report + Callback gas + Gas after payment)) / Native to Link conversion = total gas cost in LINK

  total cost in LINK = total gas cost + DON fees + Registry fees
  ```

- The _Subscription contract_ performs several accounting movements:
  - Debit the _Subscription balance_ of the total cost.
  - Pay the Registry fee.
  - Pay the oracle that reported the response: Repayment of _total gas cost_ and proportional share of the _DON_ fees.
  - Pay the oracles participating in the _DON_ with the rest of the _DON_ fees.
  - Decrease the _Subscription reservation_ of the _total estimated cost_.

## Fees

| Item          | Ethereum Sepolia testnet | Polygon Mumbai testnet |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Registry fees | 0.2 LINK                 | 0.2 LINK               |
| DON fees      | 0 LINK                   | 0 LINK                 |
