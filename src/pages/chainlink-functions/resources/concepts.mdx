_Chainlink Functions_ do not require your consumer contracts to hold LINK tokens and send them to oracles when making requests. Instead, you must create a subscription account and fund it to pre-pay for your _Chainlink Functions_ requests, so your consumer contracts don't need to hold LINK when calling _Chainlink Functions_.

Before you explore how Chainlink Functions works in the [Architecture](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) guide, it is best to understand the core concepts in this guide.

## Request and Receive Data

This model is similar to the [Basic Request Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model): Consumer contracts initiate the cycle by creating requests to Functions Oracle contracts. Oracle nodes watch for events emitted by the [Functions Oracle contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/dev/functions/FunctionsOracle.sol) and run the computation off-chain. Finally, oracle nodes use the [Chainlink OCR](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) protocol to aggregate all the responses before passing the aggregated responses to the consumer contracts in callbacks. Note: As long as you use vanilla Node.js (no modules imports), you can decentralize any computation you want such as API calls, computing maths operations, etc.

## Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)

_Chainlink Functions_ are powered by a [Decentralized Oracle Network](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles#decentralized-oracles). The oracle nodes are independent of each other and are responsible for running the same function such as API calls, computing maths operations, etc. The nodes use the [Chainlink OCR](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) protocol to aggregate all the nodes' responses. Finally, a DON's oracle sends the aggregate response to the consumer contract in a callback.

## Subscriptions

- Subscriptions App: A user interface that interacts with the _Subscriptions Contract_. **Note**: The _Subscriptions App_ is not available now, we recommend using the [functions hardhat starter kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) to interact with the _Subscriptions Contract_.
- Subscriptions Contract (aka [Functions Billing Registry Contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/dev/functions/FunctionsBillingRegistry.sol)): The contract that holds user funds to pay for _Chainlink Functions_ requests.
- subscription account: An account that holds LINK tokens and makes them available to fund requests to Chainlink DON. A _Subscription ID_ uniquely IDentifies each account.
- Subscription ID: 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique IDentifier of the _Subscription account_.
- Subscription owner: The wallet address that creates and manages a _Subscription account_. Any account can add LINK tokens to the subscription balance, but only the owner can add approved consuming contracts or withdraw funds.
- Subscription balance: The amount of LINK maintained on your _Subscription account_. Requests from consumer contracts will continue to be funded until the balance runs out, so be sure to maintain sufficient funds in your _Subscription balance_ to pay for the requests and keep your applications running.
- Subscription reservation: The amount of LINK blocked on the _Subscription balance_. It corresponds to the total LINK amount to be paid by in-flight requests.
- Effective balance: The amount of LINK available on your _Subscription account_. `Effective balance = Subscription balance - Subscription reservation`.
- Subscription consumers: Consumer contracts are approved to use funding from your _Subscription account_ while making _Chainlink Functions_ requests. The consumers receive response data in a callback.
