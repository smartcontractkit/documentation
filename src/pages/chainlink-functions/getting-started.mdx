Use the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to set up your on-chain contracts, test your requests, and send your requests to be fulfilled by the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). Chainlink Functions is available on Sepolia and Polygon Mumbai, but this guide uses Polygon Mumbai to simplify access to testnet funds. Complete the following tasks to get started with Chainlink Functions:

- Set up your Web3 wallet and find your private key
- Install the required frameworks
- Configure the starter kit with your environment variables
- Simulate a Chainlink Functions request
- Set up a subscription for Chainlink Functions
- Send a Chainlink Functions request to the DON

<Aside type="note" title="Request Access">
  Chainlink Functions is currently in a limited BETA. Apply [here](http://functions.chain.link/) to add your EVM account
  address to the Allow List.

## Set up your environment

You must provide the private key from a testnet wallet to run the examples in this documentation. Install a Web3 wallet, configure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), clone the [Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit.git), and configure a `.env` file with the required variables.

Install and configure your Web3 wallet for Polygon Mumbai:

1. [Install the MetaMask wallet](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) or other Ethereum Web3 wallet.

1. Set the network for your wallet to the Polygon Mumbai testnet. If you need to add Mumbai to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#mumbai-testnet) page.

   - <a
       class="erc-token-address"
       id="80001_0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB"
       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#mumbai-testnet"
     >
       Polygon Mumbai testnet
     </a>

1. Request testnet MATIC from the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

1. Request testnet LINK from [faucets.chain.link/mumbai](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai).

Install the required frameworks and dependencies:

1.  [Install Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Optionally, you can use the [nvm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) to switch between Node.js versions with `nvm use 18`.

    **Note**: The starter kit only supports node versions at 18 or higher. To ensure you are running the correct version in a terminal, type `node -v`.

    ```shell
    node -v
    ```

    ```shell
    $ node -v
    v18.7.0
    ```

1.  In a terminal, clone the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit.git) repository and change directories.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit.git && \
    cd functions-hardhat-starter-kit/
    ```

1.  Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1.  For higher security, the starter kit encrypts your environment variables at rest.

            1.  Set an encryption password for your environment variables.

                  ```shell
                  npx env-enc set-pw
                  ```

            1.  Run `npx env-enc set` to configure a `.env.enc` file with the basic variables that you need to send your requests to the Polygon Mumbai network.

                  - `POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL`: Set a URL for the Polygon Mumbai testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

                  - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Find the private key for your testnet wallet. If you use MetaMask, follow the instructions to [Export a Private Key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key). Set this in the `.env` file. **Note**: The Chainlink Functions hardhat starter kit uses your private key to sign any transactions you make such as deploying your consumer contract, creating subscriptions, and making requests.

                  ```shell
                  npx env-enc set
                  ```

1.  Compile the contracts in the repository. You will see several compile warnings, but no errors.

    ```shell
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

Simulate a request to test your environment and make sure everything is configured correctly. Run the `npx hardhat functions-simulate` command. The simulation runs on a local Hardhat network (a local Ethereum network node designed for development) and executes a request defined in the default [Functions-request-config.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/Functions-request-config.js) file. The starter kit includes the capability to simulate transactions so you can quickly test your code before you send it to the DON.

```shell
npx hardhat functions-simulate
```

If the simulation is successful, the output includes the simulated on-chain response:

```text
__Simulated On-Chain Response__
Response returned to client contract represented as a hex string: 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f50ed
Decoded as a uint256: 1003757

Gas used by sendRequest: 360602
Gas used by client callback function: 75029
```

## Configure your on-chain resources

After you configure your local environment, configure some on-chain resources to process your requests, receive the responses, and pay for the work done by the DON.

Deploy an on-chain [FunctionsConsumer.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/FunctionsConsumer.sol) contract, create a [subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions), and fund the subscription with LINK to pay for requests after they are fulfilled.

1. Deploy the consumer contract and record the contract address. For now, you can skip on-chain contract verification with the `--verify false` flag. If you do need to [verify](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-verify-a-smart-contract-on-etherscan) your contract on-chain, sign up for a [free Polygonscan API key](https://polygonscan.com/login) and include the key in your `.env.enc` file by running `npx env-enc set` and set `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY`.

   ```shell
   npx hardhat functions-deploy-client --network polygonMumbai --verify false
   ```

   Find the contract address in the output:

   ```text
   FunctionsConsumer contract deployed to 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea on mumbai
   ```

1. Create a Chainlink Functions subscription and add your contract as an approved consumer contract. You can do this with a single transaction if you include your contract address with the `--contract` flag. For this example, 1 LINK is more than enough on the Mumbai testnet. You can always get more LINK from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai) and later add it to the subscription. See the [Subscriptions Management](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) page for details.

   ```shell
   npx hardhat functions-sub-create --network polygonMumbai --amount 1 --contract YOUR_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   ```

   Record the subscription ID from the output.

   ```text
   Created subscription with ID: 443
   Owner: 0x9d087fC03ae39b088326b67fA3C788236645b717
   Balance: 1.0 LINK
   1 authorized consumer contract:
   [ '0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea' ]
   ```

## Run the example request

After your environment and on-chain resources are configured, you can send your request to the DON to execute the request defined in the [Functions-request-config.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/Functions-request-config.js) file. Run `npx hardhat functions-request`. Specify your subscription ID with the `--subid` flag and specify your consumer contract address with the `--contract` flag.

```shell
npx hardhat functions-request --subid YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --contract YOUR_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network polygonMumbai
```

The on-chain transaction and request will take longer to complete than the simulation. The output includes a decoded response:

```text
Actual amount billed to subscription #443:
┌──────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
│         Type         │           Amount            │
├──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│  Transmission cost:  │  0.000074413446128386 LINK  │
│      Base fee:       │          0.2 LINK           │
│                      │                             │
│     Total cost:      │  0.200074413446128386 LINK  │
└──────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘


✔ Request 0x4b97078053700c816e6ba1cd54fa5a5b4c279f36c6e4a4be690a71ba84d26819 fulfilled! Data has been written on-chain.

Response returned to client contract represented as a hex string: 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f50ed
Decoded as a uint256: 1003757
```

If your request is successful, you have all the tools that you need to make your own custom requests. Edit the [Functions-request-config.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/Functions-request-config.js) file and the [calculation-example.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/calculation-example.js) source file with your own code. Then, run the `npx hardhat functions-request` command again to test your changes. You can re-use the same consumer contract and subscription for different requests.

Chainlink Functions is capable of much more than just computation. Try one of the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) to see examples that can GET and POST to public APIs, securely handle API secrets, handle custom responses, and query multiple APIs.
