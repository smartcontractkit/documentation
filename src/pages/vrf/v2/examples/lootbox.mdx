The lootbox utility contract uses Chainlink VRF to determine a random reward that you can distribute as a [Loot Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box) to users. This allows you to issue rewards fairly and transparently using verified randomness that the recipients can verify on-chain.

## Overview

If you need to create a reward distribution dApp, this example demonstrates a basic example to help you get started. In this tutorial, you will use example code from the [smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox) repository. You will configure the example to work on a testnet of your choice, use an RPC endpoint of your choice, and issue tokens to an end-user in a lootbox contract. This example uses the [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/) framework to help you complete the testing and deployment steps.

This example contract supports [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), and [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) tokens as rewards. The rewards are distributed from a pool of tokens that are transferred to the lootbox contract when you deploy it.

<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">
  This tutorial is an example to help you learn how to integrate Chainlink services and integrate them into your own
  dApps. This template is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, has not been audited, and may be missing key
  checks or error handling to make the usage of the product more clear. Do not use the code in this example in a
  production environment without completing your own audits and application of best practices.

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract).
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - Run `git --version` to check the installation. You should see an output similar to `git version x.x.x`.
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.0.0 or higher
  - Run `node --version` to check the installation. You should see an output similar to `v16.x.x`.
  - Optionally, you can also [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) and use it to run this example instead of using `npm`.
- [Create an Etherscan API key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) if you do not already have one.
- Create an account with [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) to use as an RPC endpoint if you do not already have one. Alternatively, you can [use your own testnet clients](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client).

Your _deployer account_ is the main account that you will use to deploy the lootbox contract, distribute reward tokens, pay for transaction fees, and pay for VRF costs.

- Ensure the deployer account owns all the tokens you wish to distribute as rewards.
- To deploy this contract on testnets, ensure the deployer account has testnet LINK and testnet ETH (Sepolia). Use the [LINK faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/) to retrieve 20 testnet LINK and 0.1 Sepolia ETH.
- Ensure the deployer account has enough LINK to fund the [VRF subscription](/vrf/v2/subscription). If you don't already have a VRF subscription, the deployment script will create and fund one for you.

  - [Estimate the minimum subscription balance](/vrf/v2/estimating-costs#estimate-minimum-subscription-balance) that VRF requires to process your randomness request. The minimum subscription balance provides a buffer against gas volatility, and only the actual cost of your request will be deducted from your account. If your subscription is underfunded, your VRF request will be [pending](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui#pending) for 24 hours. If that happens, check the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link]) to see the additional balance needed.
  - The initial funding amount is set to 10 LINK. Optionally, you can modify the initial funding amount in [`network-config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/network-config.ts).

- [Create a second account in your MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289452-How-to-create-an-additional-account-in-your-wallet). This account is called the _receiving account_ in this tutorial. You will use this _receiving account_ to open a test lootbox and receive the reward tokens as a user. [Configure the account](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-display-tokens-in-MetaMask) to display the reward tokens that you want to distribute from the lootbox.

### Configure your project

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configure the Hardhat project

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is an Ethereum development environment that is used here to configure and deploy the lootbox contract. You need the following information:

- The [RPC URL for your deployment network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config#json-rpc-based-networks), using an [RPC node provider](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) such as [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).
- The [private key for your deployer account](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/verifying#deploying-and-verifying-a-contract-in-the-sepolia-testnet). If your deployer account is in MetaMask, [export your private key from MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).
- An [Etherscan API key](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/verifying#getting-an-api-key-from-etherscan) for contract verification. [Create an Etherscan API key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) if you do not already have one.

1. In your `.env` file, fill in these values:

   | Parameter           | Description                                                 | Example                                     |
   | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
   | `NETWORK_RPC_URL`   | The RPC URL for the network you want to deploy to.          | `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-api-key` |
   | `PRIVATE_KEY`       | The private key of the account you want to deploy from.     | `0xabc123abc123abc123abc123abc123...`       |
   | `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` | The API key for Etherscan needed for contract verification. | `ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC1`        |

1. If you're using a deployment network other than Sepolia, Goerli, or Ethereum: configure your deployment network in both the `.env` file and in the [`hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts) file.

### Set your contract parameters

In your `.env` file, fill in these values:

| Parameter                             | Description                                                                                                               | Example      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `LOOTBOX_FEE_PER_OPEN`                | The fee per open in ETH                                                                                                   | `0.05`       |
| `LOOTBOX_AMOUNT_DISTRIBUTED_PER_OPEN` | The amount of reward units distributed per open                                                                           | `1`          |
| `LOOTBOX_OPEN_START_TIMESTAMP`        | The start timestamp in UNIX time for the public open. Leave blank to start immediately.                                   | `1630000000` |
| `VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`                 | A funded Chainlink VRF subscription ID. If you leave this blank, a new subscription will be created and funded on deploy. | `7123`       |

The `LOOTBOX_FEE_PER_OPEN` allows you to pass transaction and VRF costs to the user when they open the lootbox.

### Define the reward tokens

For rewards, the lootbox contracts supports any tokens from the following [token standards](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/):

- [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/): the fungible token standard
- [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/): the NFT standard
- [ERC-1155](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/): the multi-token standard

The amounts per unit are used to calculate the lootbox supply of rewards. For example, if you want to distribute 100 tokens of a specific ERC-20 token, you would set the `totalAmount` to `100000000000000000000` and the `amountPerUnit` to `1000000000000000000`. This would result in a lootbox supply of 100 units. For testing, you can distribute a smaller amount of testnet tokens.

Add all the tokens you want to distribute as rewards to the array in the list of tokens by following the format below.

<Aside type="note">The deployer account must own all the tokens you want to distribute as rewards.</Aside>

There's an example configuration file in [`scripts/data/tokens.json`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/scripts/data/tokens.json) which includes a list of all supported token types:

### Create an allow list for private mints

The [Merkle tree](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/merkle-proofs-for-offline-data-integrity/#introduction) for the [private opening mode](#private-mode) is generated from the address list in the [`scripts/data/whitelist.json`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/scripts/data/whitelist.json) file. Edit the file and add all the addresses you want to list.

For this tutorial, add the address for your secondary account that you'll use to receive the reward tokens when you test opening the lootbox.

If you don't want to do a private mint, leave the `whitelist.json` file empty, and the contract will be initialized in [public opening mode](#public-mode).

### Post-deployment configuration

After deployment, you can optionally change some contract parameters by calling the following functions from the owner account:

| Function           | Description                             | Parameters           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `setWhitelistRoot` | Set new Merkle root for the allow list. | `whitelistRoot`      |
| `setPrivateOpen`   | Enable/disable public opening mode.     | `privateOpenEnabled` |

## Deploy and run the example lootbox contract

Now that your example is configured, you can test, deploy, and run the example. Then, switch accounts to act as a user who received the lootbox and receive the example rewards.

### Test the example

Run several tests before you deploy the contract.

1. Run the unit tests to ensure the configuration is valid:

```bash
npm run test
```

1. View gas usage to make sure it falls within the expected range:

```bash
REPORT_GAS=true npm run test
```

1. Generate coverage reports:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

Next, deploy the example.

### Deploy the example contract

Run the `npx hardhat run` command and replace `<network>` with the network that you want to deploy to. The network must be configured in [`hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts).

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
```

The [deploy script](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/scripts/deploy.ts) also completes the following actions:

1.  Approve each token configured in [`scripts/data/tokens.json`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/scripts/data/tokens.json) for the deployed contract address.

    This is a mandatory step because the contract must store the tokens in its own balance. It is important to ensure the deployer account owns all the tokens you want to distribute as rewards.

1.  Generate a [Merkle tree](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/merkle-proofs-for-offline-data-integrity/#introduction) for the allow list.

1.  Create and fund a VRF subscription if one is not provided.

    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    <Aside type="note">
    Make sure the deployer account has enough LINK to fund the subscription. The initial funding amount is configured in [`network-config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/network-config.ts). For testnets, you can use the [LINK faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/).

    [Estimate the minimum subscription balance](/vrf/v2/estimating-costs#estimate-minimum-subscription-balance) that VRF requires to process your randomness request. The minimum subscription balance provides a buffer against gas volatility, and only the actual cost of your request will be deducted from your account.

    If your subscription is underfunded, your VRF request will be [pending](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui#pending) for 24 hours. If this happens, check the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link]) to see the additional balance needed.

    </Aside>

1.  Add the deployed contract address as a consumer to the VRF subscription.

    If you provided a subscription ID, make sure the deployer account is the owner of the subscription. Otherwise, comment out the `addVrfConsumer` function in the deploy script and add the contract address manually.

1.  Verify the contract on Etherscan. This is important to show users the source code for the contract so they can confirm how it works. If you want to skip this step during testing, comment out the `verify` function in the deploy script.

Next, switch accounts and open the lootbox as a user to test the contract.

## Open the lootbox

Once the contract is deployed and the start timestamp is reached, users can start opening the lootbox. The amount of rewards they receive depends on the amount of units they open by specifying the `amountToOpen` parameter and paying the corresponding fee.

You can control access to the lootbox with two modes: private and public. Use these modes to determine which users can open the lootbox. The owner account can update this setting after deployment, so you can test the opening functionality privately before making the lootbox available to the public.

### Private mode

In this mode, the lootbox is only open to addresses on the allow list by calling the `privateOpen` function and providing Merkle proof for the address. To generate it, see [merkletreejs](https://github.com/merkletreejs/merkletreejs).

The allow list is set on contract deployment and can be changed by calling the `setWhitelistRoot` function from the owner account. The private mode can be enabled or disabled at any time by calling the `setPrivateOpen` function from the owner account.

### Public mode

When the private mode is disabled, anyone can open the lootbox by calling the `publicOpen` function. It will do the same thing as the `privateOpen` function but without the Merkle proof.

## Randomness

The contract uses [Chainlink VRF](https://vrf.chain.link) to generate randomness which is used to determine the rewards the user receives.

Because the randomness is generated off-chain, the contract will not be able to transfer the rewards immediately. Instead, it will store the request and once the randomness is received, the user or anyone else can call the `claimRewards` function to transfer the rewards to the user.

The lootbox creator can also call the `claimRewards` function and improve the user experience by transferring the rewards to the user immediately. You can automate this further by using [Chainlink Automation](https://automation.chain.link/).

## Claim rewards

The rewards for an open request can be claimed by calling the `claimRewards` function and passing the opener address as the parameter. This will transfer the rewards to the opener address.

The claim function can only be called after the randomness is fulfilled. To check this, call the `canClaimRewards` function and pass the opener address as the parameter.

One address can only have one open request at a time. If you try to open the lootbox again before the previous request is fulfilled, the transaction reverts with a `PendingOpenRequest` error.

## Withdraw funds

At any time, the owner can withdraw funds from the collected fees by calling the `withdraw` function. By doing so, the contract balance will be transferred to the owner account.

## Code example

The main part of this tutorial is in the [`Lootbox.sol` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-lootbox/blob/main/contracts/Lootbox.sol). The Lootbox contract manages the following tasks:

- Requests a random value from VRF for each open request
- Uses the random value as a seed to determine the reward
- Tracks and validates requests to open the lootbox
- Transfers reward tokens to the user, for valid requests
- Tracks how many reward tokens remain in the lootbox
- Validates user addresses against the allowlist, if in private mode

This section focuses on how VRF is used in the lootbox contract.

### How the lootbox interacts with the VRF service

The processing done in the `fulfillRandomWords` callback function is minimal. Here, the function simply stores the randomness result from VRF and emits an event to indicate that the randomness is ready, so the lootbox open request can now be fulfilled. Reducing the computational processing in your `fulfillRandomWords` callback function makes the callback more gas efficient, and it reduces the chance that your `callbackGasLimit` will be too low for the VRF request to go through.

                    rewardUnits[i].assetContract = tokens[j].assetContract;
                    rewardUnits[i].tokenType = tokens[j].tokenType;
