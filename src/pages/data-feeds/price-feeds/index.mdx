Chainlink Data Feeds are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to the real-world market prices of assets. For example, one use for data feeds is to enable smart contracts to retrieve the latest pricing data of an asset in a single call.

This guide applies specifically to using data feeds on EVM Chains. To get the full list of Chainlink Price Feeds running on the EVM Chains, see the [Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/) page.

For important updates regarding the use of Chainlink Price Feeds, users should join the official Chainlink Discord and subscribe to the data-feeds-user-notifications channel: [https://discord.gg/Dqy5N9UbsR](https://discord.gg/Dqy5N9UbsR)

These examples show you how to get the price of Ethereum (ETH) on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, but you can modify the examples to work on other chains as well. The list of price feeds for each network are available on the [Data Feed Contracts](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/) page. For development, use testnet data feeds such as the [BTC / USD feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43) on the Sepolia testnet.

You can write smart contracts that consume Price Feeds using several languages, but this guide shows examples using the following languages:

- [Solidity](#solidity)
- [Vyper](#vyper)
- [Javascript](#javascript) with [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
- [Python](#python) with [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Golang](#golang) with [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

## Solidity

To consume price data, your smart contract should reference [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol), which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.

<CodeSample src="samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol" />

The `latestRoundData` function returns five values representing information about the latest price data. See the [Data Feeds API Reference](/data-feeds/price-feeds/api-reference/) for more details.

## Vyper

To consume price data, your smart contract should import `AggregatorV3Interface` which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds. You can find it [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.vy).
You can find a `PriceConsumer` example [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/PriceConsumer.vy). Read the _**apeworx-starter-kit**_ [README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit) to learn how to run the example.

## Javascript

This example uses [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) to retrieve feed data from the [BTC / USD feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43) on the Sepolia testnet.

<LatestPrice client:idle feedAddress={priceFeedAddresses.btc.usd.sepolia.address} supportedChain="ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA" />

## Python

This example uses [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to retrieve feed data from the [BTC / USD feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43) on the Sepolia testnet.

</a>

## Golang

You can find an example with all the source files [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/pricefeed-golang). This example uses [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) to retrieve feed data from the [BTC / USD feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43) on the Sepolia testnet.
To learn how to run the example, see the [README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/pricefeed-golang/README.md).

<Aside type="note" title="New Feed Registry">
  You can use the [Feed Registry](/data-feeds/feed-registry/) to reference data feed assets by name or currency
  identifier instead of by pair/proxy address.
</Aside>

## Getting a different price denomination

Chainlink Data Feeds can be used in combination to derive denominated price pairs in other currencies.

If you require a denomination other than what is provided, you can use two data feeds to derive the pair that you need. For example, if you needed a BTC / EUR price, you could take the BTC / USD feed and the EUR / USD feed and derive BTC / EUR using division.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  If your contracts require Solidity versions that are `>=0.6.0 <0.8.0`, use [OpenZeppelin's SafeMath version 3.4](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.4/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol).
</Aside>

<CodeSample src="samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConverter.sol" />

## How Do Data Feeds Get Their Data?

Data Feeds are aggregated from many data sources by a decentralized set of independent Node Operators. The [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model/) describes this in detail.

## More Aggregator Functions

Getting the latest price is not the only data that aggregators can retrieve. You can also retrieve historical price data. To learn more, see the [Historical Price Data](/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data/) page.

To understand different use cases for Chainlink Price Feeds, refer to [Other Tutorials](/getting-started/other-tutorials/).
