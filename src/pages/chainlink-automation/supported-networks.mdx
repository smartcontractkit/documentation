## Parameters

- **Payment Premium %** (`paymentPremiumPPB`): This percentage premium compensates the Chainlink Automation Network for monitoring and performing your upkeep. Every time a transaction is submitted for your upkeep, your LINK balance is reduced by the cost plus this percentage premium.
- **Block Count Per Turn** (`blockCountPerTurn`): The number of blocks in each turn before the Upkeep is rotated to the next Automation Node.
- **Check Gas Limit** (`checkGasLimit`): The maximum amount of gas that can be used by your checkUpkeep for off-chain computation.
- **Call Gas Limit** (`callGasLimit`): The maximum amount of gas that can be used by the client contract’s `performUpkeep` function for the on-chain transaction. You can set an upper limit on your upkeep during registration, but this number must not exceed the call gas limit on the `KeeperRegistry` contract.
- **Gas Ceiling Multiplier** (`gasCeilingMultiplier`): Establishes a ceiling for the maximum price based on the on-chain fast gas feed.
