This guide explains how to get random values using a simple contract to request and receive random values from Chainlink VRF v2.5 without managing a subscription. To explore more applications of VRF, refer to our [blog](https://blog.chain.link/).

## Requirements

This guide assumes that you know how to create and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum testnets using the following tools:

- [The Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Sepolia testnet ETH](/resources/link-token-contracts/#sepolia-testnet)

If you are new to developing smart contracts on Ethereum, see the [Getting Started](/getting-started/conceptual-overview) guide to learn the basics.

## Create and deploy a VRF compatible contract

For this example, use the [DirectFundingConsumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/v2-5/DirectFundingConsumer.sol) sample contract. This contract imports the following dependencies:

- `VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerBase.sol`[(link)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerBase.sol)
- `VRFV2PlusClient.sol`[(link)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/libraries/VRFV2PlusClient.sol)

The contract also includes pre-configured values for the necessary request parameters such as `callbackGasLimit`, `requestConfirmations`, the number of random words `numWords`, the VRF v2.5 Wrapper address `wrapperAddress`, and the LINK token address `linkAddress`. You can change these parameters if you want to experiment on different testnets.

Build and deploy the contract on Sepolia.

1. Open the [`DirectFundingConsumer.sol` contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/v2-5/DirectFundingConsumer.sol) in Remix.

   {/* prettier-ignore */}
   <CodeSample src="samples/VRF/v2-5/DirectFundingConsumer.sol" showButtonOnly/>

1. On the **Compile** tab in Remix, compile the `DirectFundingConsumer` contract.

1. Configure your deployment. On the **Deploy** tab in Remix, select the **Injected Web3 Environment** and select the `DirectFundingConsumer` contract from the contract list.

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy your contract onchain. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

1. After you deploy your contract, copy the address from the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Before you can request randomness from VRF v2.5, you must fund your consuming contract with enough tokens in order to request for randomness. Next, [fund your contract](#fund-your-contract).

## Fund your contract

Requests for randomness will fail unless your consuming contract has enough tokens. VRF V2.5 allows you to use either native tokens or LINK to pay for your requests.

1. [Acquire testnet LINK and Sepolia ETH](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).
1. [Fund your contract](/resources/fund-your-contract) with either testnet LINK or Sepolia ETH, depending on how you want to pay for your VRF requests. For this example, fund your contract with 2 LINK or 0.01 Sepolia ETH. (The actual request cost is closer to 0.877 LINK or 0.001 ETH. You can [withdraw the excess funds](#clean-up) after you're done with this contract.)

## Request random values

The deployed contract requests random values from Chainlink VRF, receives those values, builds a struct `RequestStatus` containing them, and stores the struct in a mapping `s_requests`. Run the `requestRandomWords()` function on your contract to start the request.

1.  Return to Remix and view your deployed contract functions in the **Deployed Contracts** list.

1.  Expand the `requestRandomWords()` function. For `enableNativePayment`, fill in `true` if you're paying for your request with Sepolia ETH, or `false` if you're paying with testnet LINK. Click **transact** to send the request for random values to Chainlink VRF. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

    After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF processes your request. Chainlink VRF fulfills the request and returns the random values to your contract in a callback to the `fulfillRandomWords()` function. At this point, a new key `requestId` is added to the mapping `s_requests`. Depending on current testnet conditions, it might take a few minutes for the callback to return the requested random values to your contract.

1.  To fetch the request ID of your request, call `lastRequestId()`.

1.  After the oracle returns the random values to your contract, the mapping `s_requests` is updated. The received random values are stored in `s_requests[_requestId].randomWords`.

1.  Call `getRequestStatus()` and specify the `requestId` to display the random words.

<Aside type="note" title="Note on Requesting or Cancelling Randomness">
  Do not allow re-requesting or cancellation of randomness. For more information, see the [VRF Security
  Considerations](/vrf/v2-5/security#do-not-allow-re-requesting-or-cancellation-of-randomness) page.

## Analyzing the contract

In this example, the consuming contract uses static configuration parameters.

<CodeSample src="samples/VRF/v2-5/DirectFundingConsumer.sol" />

The parameters define how your requests will be processed. You can find the values for your network in the [Supported networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page.

- `uint32 callbackGasLimit`: The limit for how much gas to use for the callback request to your contract's `fulfillRandomWords()` function. It must be less than the `maxGasLimit` limit on the coordinator contract minus the `wrapperGasOverhead`. See the [VRF v2.5 Direct funding limits](/vrf/v2-5/overview/direct-funding#limits) for more details. Adjust this value for larger requests depending on how your `fulfillRandomWords()` function processes and stores the received random values. If your `callbackGasLimit` is not sufficient, the callback will fail and your consuming contract is still charged for the work done to generate your requested random values.

- `uint16 requestConfirmations`: How many confirmations the Chainlink node should wait before responding. The longer the node waits, the more secure the random value is. It must be greater than the `minimumRequestBlockConfirmations` limit on the coordinator contract.

- `uint32 numWords`: How many random values to request. If you can use several random values in a single callback, you can reduce the amount of gas that you spend per random value. The total cost of the callback request depends on how your `fulfillRandomWords()` function processes and stores the received random values, so adjust your `callbackGasLimit` accordingly.

The contract includes the following functions:

- `requestRandomWords()`: Takes your specified parameters and submits the request to the VRF v2.5 Wrapper contract.

- `fulfillRandomWords()`: Receives random values and stores them with your contract.

- `getRequestStatus()`: Retrieve request details for a given `_requestId`.

- `withdrawLink()`: At any time, the owner of the contract can withdraw the outstanding LINK balance from it.

- `withdrawNative()`: At any time, the owner of the contract can withdraw the outstanding native token balance from it.

  Be sure to review your contracts to make sure they follow the best practices on the [security
  considerations](/vrf/v2-5/security) page.

## Clean up

After you are done with this contract, you can retrieve the remaining testnet tokens to use with other examples:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<TabsContent sharedStore="feePaymentType" client:visible>
<Fragment slot="tab.1">LINK</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="tab.2">Native tokens</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="panel.1">
Call the `withdrawLink()` function. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, the remaining LINK will be transferred from your consuming contract to your wallet address.
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="panel.2">
Call `getBalance` to retrieve your contract's ETH balance in wei, and then pass that into the `withdrawNative()` function. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, the remaining Sepolia ETH will be transferred from your consuming contract to your wallet address.
</Fragment>
</TabsContent>
