## 2024-07-15 - Deprecation announcement

VRF V2 and V1 will be deprecated on November 29, 2024. Please [migrate to VRF V2.5](/vrf/v2-5/migration-from-v2) before then.

The docs for VRF V2 are still available and have been moved to the legacy section:

- [VRF V2 Subscription method](/vrf/v2/subscription)
- [VRF V2 Direct funding method](/vrf/v2/direct-funding)

## 2024-05-24 - Updated VRF V2.5 contracts

The [`@chainlink/contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts/v/1.1.1) package version 1.1.1 is now available. It includes the updated wrapper and interface contracts for VRF 2.5 direct funding, which had not been included in the `@chainlink/contracts` package version 1.1.0. The `DirectFundingConsumer.sol` example contract has been updated to reflect this.

The [`@chainlink/contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts/v/1.1.1) also includes an updated function signature for `fulfillRandomWords` in the `VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus` contract, which applies only to subscription users. This function signature has **not** changed in the `VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerBase`, so this does not affect direct funding users.

When using package version 1.1.1 and later, update your `fulfillRandomWords` function signature to match the `VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus` contract, which has changed to:

```
function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] calldata randomWords)
```

In the `@chainlink/contracts` package version 1.1.0 and earlier, the `randomWords` parameter has a `memory` storage location.

## 2024-04-29 - VRF V2.5 released on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum

VRF V2.5 is available on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum mainnets and testnets.

The new version of Chainlink VRF implements the following changes:

- Support for native gas token billing
- Easy 1-click migration to future new versions
- New [billing model](/vrf/v2-5/billing), where the premium is a percentage of the gas costs of the VRF callback instead of a flat fee
- Gas optimizations
