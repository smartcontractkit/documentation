This guide explains how to get random values using a simple contract to request and receive random values from Chainlink VRF v2 without managing a subscription. To explore more applications of VRF, refer to our [blog](https://blog.chain.link/).

## Requirements

This guide assumes that you know how to create and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum testnets using the following tools:

- [The Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Sepolia testnet ETH](/resources/link-token-contracts/#sepolia-testnet)

If you are new to developing smart contracts on Ethereum, see the [Getting Started](/getting-started/conceptual-overview) guide to learn the basics.

## Create and deploy a VRF v2 compatible contract

For this example, use the [VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer.sol) sample contract. This contract imports the following dependencies:

- `VRFV2WrapperConsumerBase.sol`[(link)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFV2WrapperConsumerBase.sol)
- `ConfirmedOwner.sol`[(link)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/access/ConfirmedOwner.sol)

The contract also includes pre-configured values for the necessary request parameters such as `callbackGasLimit`, `requestConfirmations`, the number of random words `numWords`, the VRF v2 Wrapper address `wrapperAddress`, and the LINK token address `linkAddress`. You can change these parameters if you want to experiment on different testnets.

Build and deploy the contract on Sepolia.

1. Open the [`VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer.sol` contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer.sol) in Remix.

   {/* prettier-ignore */}
   <CodeSample src="samples/VRF/VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer.sol" showButtonOnly/>

1. On the **Compile** tab in Remix, compile the `VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer` contract.

1. Configure your deployment. On the **Deploy** tab in Remix, select the **Injected Web3 Environment** and select the `VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer` contract from the contract list.

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy your contract onchain. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

1. After you deploy your contract, copy the address from the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Before you can request randomness from VRF v2, you must fund your consuming contract with enough LINK tokens in order to request for randomness. Next, [fund your contract](#fund-your-contract).

## Fund Your Contract

Requests for randomness will fail unless your consuming contract has enough LINK.

1. [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
1. [Fund your contract with testnet LINK](/resources/fund-your-contract). For this example, funding your contract with 2 LINK should be sufficient.

## Request random values

The deployed contract requests random values from Chainlink VRF, receives those values, builds a struct `RequestStatus` containing them, and stores the struct in a mapping `s_requests`. Run the `requestRandomWords()` function on your contract to start the request.

1.  Return to Remix and view your deployed contract functions in the **Deployed Contracts** list.

1.  Click the `requestRandomWords()` function to send the request for random values to Chainlink VRF. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

           <Aside type="note" title="Set your gas limit in MetaMask">
        Remix IDE doesn't set the right gas limit, so you must [edit the
        gas limit in MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972) within the **Advanced gas controls** settings.

            For this example to work, set the gas limit to _400,000_ in MetaMask.

            First, [enable **Advanced gas controls** in your MetaMask settings](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972).

            Before confirming your transaction in MetaMask, navigate to the screen where you can edit the gas limit: Select **Site suggested** > **Advanced** > **Advanced gas controls** and select **Edit** next to the **Gas limit** amount. Update the **Gas limit** value to _400000_ and select **Save**. Finally, confirm the transaction.

           </Aside>

    After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF processes your request. Chainlink VRF fulfills the request and returns the random values to your contract in a callback to the `fulfillRandomWords()` function. At this point, a new key `requestId` is added to the mapping `s_requests`. Depending on current testnet conditions, it might take a few minutes for the callback to return the requested random values to your contract.

1.  To fetch the request ID of your request, call `lastRequestId()`.

1.  After the oracle returns the random values to your contract, the mapping `s_requests` is updated. The received random values are stored in `s_requests[_requestId].randomWords`.

1.  Call `getRequestStatus()` and specify the `requestId` to display the random words.

<Aside type="note" title="Note on Requesting or Cancelling Randomness">
  Do not allow re-requesting or cancellation of randomness. For more information, see the [VRF Security
  Considerations](/vrf/v2/security#do-not-allow-re-requesting-or-cancellation-of-randomness) page.

## Analyzing the contract

In this example, the consuming contract uses static configuration parameters.

<CodeSample src="samples/VRF/VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer.sol" />

The parameters define how your requests will be processed. You can find the values for your network in the [Supported networks](/vrf/v2/direct-funding/supported-networks) page.

- `uint32 callbackGasLimit`: The limit for how much gas to use for the callback request to your contract's `fulfillRandomWords()` function. It must be less than the `maxGasLimit` limit on the coordinator contract minus the `wrapperGasOverhead`. See the [VRF v2 Direct funding limits](/vrf/v2/direct-funding/#limits) for more details. Adjust this value for larger requests depending on how your `fulfillRandomWords()` function processes and stores the received random values. If your `callbackGasLimit` is not sufficient, the callback will fail and your consuming contract is still charged for the work done to generate your requested random values.

- `uint16 requestConfirmations`: How many confirmations the Chainlink node should wait before responding. The longer the node waits, the more secure the random value is. It must be greater than the `minimumRequestBlockConfirmations` limit on the coordinator contract.

- `uint32 numWords`: How many random values to request. If you can use several random values in a single callback, you can reduce the amount of gas that you spend per random value. The total cost of the callback request depends on how your `fulfillRandomWords()` function processes and stores the received random values, so adjust your `callbackGasLimit` accordingly.

The contract includes the following functions:

- `requestRandomWords()`: Takes your specified parameters and submits the request to the VRF v2 Wrapper contract.

- `fulfillRandomWords()`: Receives random values and stores them with your contract.

- `getRequestStatus()`: Retrive request details for a given `_requestId`.

- `withdrawLink()`: At any time, the owner of the contract can withdraw outstanding LINK balance from it.

<Aside type="note" title="Security Considerations">
  Be sure to review your contracts to make sure they follow the best practices on the [security
  considerations](/vrf/v2/security) page.
</Aside>

## Clean up

After you are done with this contract, you can retrieve the remaining testnet LINK to use with other examples.

1. Call `withdrawLink()` function. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, the remaining LINK will be transferred from your consuming contract to your wallet address.
