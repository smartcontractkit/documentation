<Aside type="tip" title="VRF V2.5 Subscription Mock Tutorial">
  Refer to the [VRF V2.5 version of this subscription mock tutorial](/vrf/v2-5/subscription/test-locally) to learn how
  to test locally with VRF V2.5. To compare V2.5 and V2, refer to the [migration guide](/vrf/v2-5/migration-from-v2).
</Aside>

<VrfCommon callout="subscription" />

This guide explains how to test Chainlink VRF v2 on a [Remix IDE](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html#environment) sandbox blockchain environment. **Note**: You can reuse the same logic on another development environment, such as Hardhat or Truffle. For example, read the Hardhat Starter Kit [RandomNumberConsumer unit tests](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/test/unit/RandomNumberConsumer.spec.js).

<Aside type="caution" title="Test on public testnets thoroughly">
  Even though local testing has several benefits, testing with a VRF mock covers the bare minimum of use cases. Make
  sure to test your consumer contract throughly on public testnets.

## Benefits of local testing

<ContentCommon section="localTestingBenefits" />

## Testing logic

Complete the following tasks to test your VRF v2 consumer locally:

1. Deploy the [VRFCoordinatorV2Mock](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/mocks/VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol). This contract is a mock of the [VRFCoordinatorV2](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol) contract.
1. Call the VRFCoordinatorV2Mock [createSubscription function](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/mocks/VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol#L194) to create a new subscription.
1. Call the VRFCoordinatorV2Mock [fundSubscription function](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/mocks/VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol#L156) to fund your newly created subscription. **Note**: You can fund with an arbitrary amount.
1. Deploy your VRF consumer contract.
1. Call the VRFCoordinatorV2Mock [addConsumer function](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/mocks/VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol#L230) to add your consumer contract to your subscription.
1. Request random words from your consumer contract.
1. Call the VRFCoordinatorV2Mock [fulfillRandomWords function](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/mocks/VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol#L108) to fulfill your consumer contract request.

## Testing

### Open the contracts on RemixIDE

Open _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ and compile in Remix:

<CodeSample src="samples/VRF/mock/VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol" />

Open _VRFv2Consumer_ and compile in Remix:

<CodeSample src="samples/VRF/mock/VRFv2Consumer.sol" />

Your RemixIDE file explorer should display _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol_ and _VRFv2Consumer.sol_:

<ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-subscription-remix-fileexplorer.jpg" />

### Deploy VRFCoordinatorV2Mock

1. Open _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol_.

1. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deploymock.jpg" />

1. Under _DEPLOY_, fill in the `_BASEFEE` and `_GASPRICELINK`. These variables are used in the _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract to represent the base fee and the gas price (in LINK tokens) for the VRF requests. You can set: `_BASEFEE=100000000000000000` and `_GASPRICELINK=1000000000`.

1. Click on _transact_ to deploy the _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract.

1. Once deployed, you should see the _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedmock.jpg" />

1. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Create and fund a subscription

1. Click on `createSubscription` to create a new subscription.

1. In the RemixIDE console, read your transaction decoded output to find the subscription ID. In this example, the subscription ID is _1_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-mocksubscription.jpg" />

1. Click on `fundSubscription` to fund your subscription. In this example, you can set the `_subid` to `1` (which is your newly created subscription ID) and the `_amount` to `1000000000000000000`.

### Deploy the VRF consumer contract

1. In the file explorer, open _VRFv2Consumer.sol_.

1. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _RandomNumberConsumerV2_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployconsumer.jpg" />

1. Under _DEPLOY_, fill in `SUBSCRIPTIONID` with your subscription ID, `vrfCoordinator` with the deployed _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ address and, _KEYHASH_ with an arbitrary `bytes32` (In this example, you can set the _KEYHASH_ to `0xd89b2bf150e3b9e13446986e571fb9cab24b13cea0a43ea20a6049a85cc807cc`).

1. Click on _transact_ to deploy the _RandomNumberConsumerV2_ contract.

1. After the consumer contract is deployed, you should see the _RandomNumberConsumerV2_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedconsumer.jpg" />

1. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Add the consumer contract to your subscription

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract.

1. Click on _addConsumer_ and fill in the `_subid` with your subscription ID and `_consumer` with your deployed consumer contract address.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-addconsumer.jpg" />

1. Click on _transact_.

### Request random words

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _RandomNumberConsumerV2_ contract.

1. Click on `requestRandomWords`.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-requestrandomwords.jpg" />

1. In the RemixIDE console, read your transaction logs to find the VRF request ID. In this example, the request ID is _1_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-requestrandomwordslogs.jpg" />

1. Note your request ID.

### Fulfill the VRF request

Because you are testing on a local blockchain environment, you must fulfill the VRF request yourself.

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract.

1. Click `fulfillRandomWords` and fill in `_requestId` with your VRF request ID and `_consumer` with your consumer contract address.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-fulfillrandomwords.jpg" />

1. Click on `transact`.

### Check the results

1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, open the functions list of your deployed _RandomNumberConsumerV2_ contract.

1. Click on `s_requestId` to display the last request ID. In this example, the output is _1_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-deployedconsumerrequestid.jpg" />

1. Each time you make a VRF request, your consumer contract requests two random words. After the request is fulfilled, the two random words are stored in the `s_randomWords` array. You can check the stored random words by reading the two first indexes of the `s_randomWords` array. To do so, click on the _s_randomWords_ function and:

   1. Fill in the index with _0_ then click on _call_ to read the first random word.

      {" "}

      <ClickToZoom src="/images/vrf/mock/v2-firstrandomword.jpg" />

   1. Fill in the index with _1_ then click on _call_ to read the second random word.

## Next steps

This guide demonstrated how to test a VRF v2 consumer contract on your local blockchain. We made the guide on RemixIDE for learning purposes, but you can reuse the same [testing logic](#testing-logic) on another development environment, such as Truffle or Hardhat. For example, read the Hardhat Starter Kit [RandomNumberConsumer unit tests](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/test/unit/RandomNumberConsumer.spec.js).
