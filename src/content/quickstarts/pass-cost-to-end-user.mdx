   1. The Xcode command line tools include `make`. If you've previously installed Xcode, skip to step 2 to verify your installation. Otherwise, open a Terminal window and run:
      ```sh
      xcode-select --install
      ```
      Alternatively, if you prefer to [use Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make), be aware that GNU `make` is installed as `gmake`.
   1.  Verify your `make` installation:
         ```sh
         make
         ```
         If `make` is installed successfully, you will get the following output:

- Run `git --version` to check your `git` installation. You should see an output similar to `git version x.x.x`. If not, install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- Get your Etherscan API key for contract verification. If you do not already have one:
  - [Create an Etherscan account](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/creating-an-account).
  - [Create an Etherscan API key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics).
- Create an account with [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) to use as an RPC endpoint if you do not already have one. Alternatively, you can [use your own testnet clients](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client).

## Setup steps

This tutorial requires several setup steps:

- [Clone the example repo](#clone-the-example-repo)
- [Configure the Foundry project](#configure-the-foundry-project)
- [Install dependencies](#install-dependencies)

### Clone the example repo

Clone the [`vrf-direct-funding-example` repo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/vrf-direct-funding-example):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:smartcontractkit/vrf-direct-funding-example.git
```

This gives you an existing [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) project to configure and use.

### Configure the Foundry project

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is an Ethereum application development toolkit that is used here to configure and deploy the contract. You need the following information:

- The RPC URL for your deployment network, using an [RPC node provider](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) such as [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).
- The private key for your deployer account. If your deployer account is in MetaMask, [export your private key from MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).
- An [Etherscan API key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) for contract verification.

1. Create an `.env` file at the root of the `vrf-direct-funding-example/` directory:

   ```
   # Network RPCs
   export RPC_URL=

   # Private key for contract deployment
   export PRIVATE_KEY=

   # Explorer API key used to verify contracts
   export EXPLORER_KEY=
   ```

1. In your `.env` file, fill in these values:

   | Parameter      | Description                                                 | Example                                     |
   | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
   | `RPC_URL`      | The RPC URL for the network you want to deploy to.          | `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-api-key` |
   | `PRIVATE_KEY`  | The private key of the account you want to deploy from.     | `0xabc123abc123abc123abc123abc123...`       |
   | `EXPLORER_KEY` | The API key for Etherscan needed for contract verification. | `ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC1`        |

### Install dependencies

At the root of the `vrf-direct-funding-example/` directory, run:

```sh
make install
```

This command will install the project dependencies, which include [chainlink](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink) and [openzepplin-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) for secure smart contract development.

### Deploy the contract

Foundry includes [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/forge), an Ethereum testing framework. The project's [Makefile](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/vrf-direct-funding-example/blob/main/Makefile) helps you invoke Forge with simple commands to start the deployment script.

At the root of the `vrf-direct-funding-example/` directory, run this command to deploy the contract:

```shell
make deploy
```

## Run the example

Test the contract as the end-user.

1. Open the [LINK Token Contract](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts) write functions for your network in an explorer. For example, on Polygon Mumbai you can open the [0x0ed18e80aacede8cb52a6043976c255eff6fedbf](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x0ed18e80aacede8cb52a6043976c255eff6fedbf#writeContract) contract.

1. Connect your wallet to the scanning app so you can run write functions.

     alt="Connect wallet to the scanner"
     style="max-width: 50%;"
   />

1. Approve the deployed contract to spend LINK. Run the `approve` function with your deployed contract address and `5000000000000000000` Juels (5 LINK) as variables. Click **Write** to run the function. Metamask asks you to approve the transaction.

     src="/images/quickstarts/pass-cost-to-end-user/approve-link-spend.webp"
     alt="Approve LINK spend"
     style="max-width: 50%;"
   />

1. Open your deployed contract in the scanner.

1. On the **Contract** tab, open the **Write Contract** functions list for your deployed contract.

1. Again, connect your wallet to the scanner so you can run write functions on the deployed contract.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/quickstarts/pass-cost-to-end-user/connect-to-scanner-deployed-contract.webp"
     alt="Connect to the scanner while viewing your deployed contract"
     style="max-width: 50%;"
   />

1. In the `requestRandomWords` function, click **Write** to initiate a request for randomness as an end-user. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/quickstarts/pass-cost-to-end-user/request-randomness.webp"
     alt="Request randomness with the Write button under requestRandomWords"
     style="max-width: 50%;"
   />

1. If the transaction is successful, you will see a **View your transaction** button.

1. On the **Read Contract** tab for your deployed contract, view the `lastRequestId` value.

1. Use this value to find the request status and view the random value.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/quickstarts/pass-cost-to-end-user/request-status-with-answer.webp"
     alt="View the request status with your lastRequestId value"
     style="max-width: 50%;"
   />

## Code example

This section explains how the [`VRFDirectFundingConsumer.sol`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/vrf-direct-funding-example/blob/main/src/VRFDirectFundingConsumer.sol) contract maps each request to its cost.

This `RequestStatus` struct is used to map attributes of each VRF request to its request ID, including its cost, its fulfillment status, and the random values generated by the VRF service in response to the request:

```solidity
struct RequestStatus {
        uint256 paid;
        bool fulfilled;
        uint256[] randomWords;
    }

mapping(uint256 => RequestStatus) public s_requests;
```

The `requestRandomWords()` function uses a method in the VRF wrapper contract to calculate the request cost upfront, and then transfers enough LINK to the VRF wrapper to cover the request. After sending the request, it sets up the `RequestStatus` with the cost and other attributes to be updated after request fulfillment.

```solidity
uint256 requestPrice = vrfWrapper.calculateRequestPrice(
            requestConfig.callbackGasLimit
        );

require(
      linkTokenContract.transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            requestPrice
      ),
      "Not enough LINK"
   );
   ...

   s_requests[requestId] = RequestStatus({
            paid: requestPrice,
            randomWords: new uint256[](0),
            fulfilled: false
        });
```

After the VRF service fulfills your randomness request, it calls back your `fulfillRandomWords()` function, where you implement logic to handle the random values. It's recommended to keep the processing in your callback function minimal to save on gas costs. In this case, the example contract updates the `RequestStatus` in the request mapping, and emits an event indicating that the request has been fulfilled. Another part of your application can listen for this event and further process the random values separately from the callback function.

```solidity
function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 _requestId, uint256[] memory _randomWords) internal override {
  require(s_requests[_requestId].paid > 0, "request not found");
  s_requests[_requestId].fulfilled = true;
  s_requests[_requestId].randomWords = _randomWords;
  emit RequestFulfilled(_requestId, _randomWords, s_requests[_requestId].paid);
}
```
