## Overview

The Giveaway Manager app is a highly configurable proof of concept for provably-fair giveaways using Chainlink Automation and VRF. It is capable of drawing winners from a CSV list or onchain entries using VRF Direct Funding and Automation. Fulfillment is not included, and this app demonstrates provably fair selection only.

## Objective

In this tutorial, you will deploy a local user interface to enable giveaways using Chainlink VRFv2 Direct Funding. The UI was designed to run simple drawings and giveaways with just a CSV list of participants. Chainlink Automation provisioning and setup are also covered to enable timed-based, dynamic drawings.

You can use this to run:

- Static Giveaways: Fairly and transparently pick winners from a participant list in CSV format. Unique participant IDs can be anything (emails, numbers, addresses). They are hashed so no user data is stored onchain.
- Dynamic Giveaways: Create a giveaway that participants can enter on their own via tx, then fairly and transparently pick winners whenever you'd like. This allows participants to register over a set period of time without the admin needing a full participant list like a static giveaway.

## Before you begin

<Aside type="note" title="New to smart contract development?">
  If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart
  Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract).
</Aside>

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- Set up a cryptocurrency wallet such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
- Fund your wallet with the following testnet tokens:
  - Request ERC-677 testnet LINK and Sepolia ETH from [faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia). You will need [at least 5.1 LINK](#required-balance-amounts) to set up each giveaway with this app.

## Steps to implement

<Accordion title="Clone the repo" number={1}>

- Run `git --version` to check your `git` installation. You should see an output similar to `git version x.x.x`. If not, install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstart-giveaway.git
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a block explorer API key" number={2}>

The recommended networks for this app are:

- Ethereum mainnet and Sepolia testnet

For demo purposes, use Sepolia for this tutorial. Create a block explorer API key to verify contracts on your preferred network:

- [Etherscan](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Set contract environment variables" number={3}>

1. Prepare the following values:

   - The RPC URL for your deployment network, using an [RPC node provider](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) such as [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).
   - The private key for your deployer account. If your deployer account is in MetaMask, [export your private key from MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).
   - The block explorer API key from Etherscan that you [created earlier](#create-a-block-explorer-api-key).

   | Parameter         | Description                                                                             | Example                                                |
   | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `NETWORK_RPC_URL` | The RPC URL for the network you want to deploy to.                                      | `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key` |
   | `PRIVATE_KEY`     | The private key of the account you want to deploy from. <br/> Add `0x` before your key. | `0xabc123abc123abc123abc123abc123...`                  |
   | `EXPLORER_KEY`    | The block explorer API key needed for contract verification.                            | `ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC1`                   |

1. In the `contracts` directory, create a `.env` file for your contract environment variables:

   ```bash
   # <root>/contracts
   $ touch .env
   $ open .env
   ```

   If you're going to push this to your own repo, make sure this `.env` file is untracked, and consider using a secure env management package instead.

1. Add this content to your file and fill in the values. Do not use quotation marks when filling in the values. Add `0x` to the beginning of your private key.

   ```bash
   # Do NOT use quotes to assign values!

   # Network RPCs
   export RPC_URL=

   # Private key for contract deployment
   export PRIVATE_KEY=

   # Explorer API key used to verify contracts
   export EXPLORER_KEY=
   ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install Foundry" number={4}>

   </Aside>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install contract dependencies" number={5}>

Install [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) if you do not already have it. The functionality of the project is wrapped in the [makefile](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-giveaway/blob/main/contracts/Makefile). Reference the below commands based on your OS or go to [Make documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html).

### macOS

   1. The Xcode command line tools include `make`. If you've previously installed Xcode, skip to step 2 to verify your installation. Otherwise, open a Terminal window and run:
      ```sh
      xcode-select --install
      ```
      Alternatively, if you prefer to [use Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make), be aware that GNU `make` is installed as `gmake`.
   1.  Verify your `make` installation:
         ```sh
         make
         ```
         If `make` is installed successfully, you will get the following output:
         ```sh
         make: *** No targets specified or no makefile found. Stop.
         ```

### Windows

   1. If you're using WSL, open an Ubuntu terminal and run:
      ```sh
      sudo apt install make
      ```
   1. [Edit your path variable to include `make`](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#Persistent_environment_variables).
   1. Verify your `make` installation:
      ```sh
      make
      ```
      If `make` is installed successfully, you will get the following output:
      ```sh
      make: *** No targets specified or no makefile found. Stop.
      ```

Install contract dependencies if changes have been made to contracts:

```bash
# <root>/contracts
$ make install
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deploy contract" number={6}>

```bash
# <root>/contracts
$ make deploy
```

Save the deployed contract address from your terminal output. This is the giveaway contract manager address that you will need when you [run the UI](#run-and-view-the-ui). Scroll up in the terminal output and look for your contract address, which appears shortly after the `Success` message:

```shell

## Reference

### Testing

To test contracts, navigate to the `contracts` directory and run the following command:

```bash
# <root>/contracts
make test-contracts-all
```

To test the UI, navigate to the `/client/packages/ui` directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# <root>/client/packages/ui
$ yarn test
$ yarn tsc
$ yarn lint
$ yarn prettier
```

### Required balance amounts

As a creator of a giveaway, the minimum token requirements are needed to ensure that your giveaway is created and finished without issues. All unused LINK token amounts are able to be withdrawn after completion of giveaway.

- 5.1 LINK
  - 0.1 (VRF request)
  - 5 (Automation subscription)

### Giveaway Status

After picking winners is initiated in the UI, the status of the giveaway is moved to `pending`. Each subsequent block is then checked to see if the VRF request has been finished and winners picked. Once found, the status is automatically moved to `finished`. The winners are then able to be viewed and leftover LINK is able to be withdrawn.

### Developer Integration for Entering Dynamic Giveaway

The Giveaway contract is able to be integrated with any application that is able to send a transaction to the contract. The user will need to call the `enterGiveaway` function with the following parameters:

- `giveawayId` - The ID of the giveaway that the user is entering
- `entries` - The amount of entries the user is purchasing
- `proof` The merkle proof of the user's entry if the giveaway is permissioned

This is how the UI in this repo calls the `enterGiveaway` function using `wagmi`:

```javascript
export const enterGiveaway = async (params: contracts.EnterGiveawayParams) => {
  try {
    const { id, proof, fee } = params
    const config = await prepareWriteContract({
      address: giveawayManagerContractAddress,
      abi: giveawayManagerABI,
      functionName: 'enterGiveaway',
      overrides: {
        value: ethers.utils.parseEther(fee)
      },
      args: [id, params.entries ? params.entries : 1, proof ? proof : []]
    })
    const data = await writeContract(config)
    return data
  } catch (error: any) {
    throw new Error(`Error entering giveaway: ${error.message}`)
  }
}

export interface EnterGiveawayParams {
  id: number
  entries?: number
  proof?: string[]
  fee: string
}
```
