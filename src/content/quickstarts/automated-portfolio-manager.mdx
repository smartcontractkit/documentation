## Overview

The Automated Portfolio Manager automatically rebalances an investment portfolio using real-time data from onchain and offchain sources. These contracts enable adjustments in asset allocations within a portfolio based on dynamic market conditions, sentiment scores, and volatility indicators such as the Gold Volatility Index (GVZ). This approach provides a modern way to manage digital assets.

A live demo is available at https://automated-portfolio-manager.vercel.app.

## Objectives

The example contract supports dynamic asset management using tokens that adhere to the ERC20 standard. For this demonstration, Mimic Tokens representing gold (mXAU), Wrapped Bitcoin (mWBTC), and Ethereum (mETH) are used as the underlying assets. These tokens are automatically bought or sold to mirror changes in crypto market sentiment and gold volatility (GVZ) to ensure the portfolio adjusts to evolving market conditions. This functionality demonstrates how blockchain and Chainlink technologies can be used to create a dynamic investment strategy that adapts to global financial movements in real time.

**Note**: In a real-world use case, you can integrate the portfolio rebalancing mechanism with any DeFi protocol, such as a swapping mechanism or investments in ERC-4626 vaults.

   [⠰] Compiling 54 files with 0.8.19
   [⠔] Solc 0.8.19 finished in 1.82s
   Compiler run successful!
   ```

## `OffchainDataFetcher` deployment and setup

<Accordion title="Deploy the contract" number={1}>

Run the following script to deploy your `OffchainDataFetcher` contract on Ethereum Sepolia:

```bash
forge script script/DeployOffChainDataFetcher.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL_SEPOLIA --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify -vvvv
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add the contract to your Functions subscription and configure it" number={2}>

1. Open the `functions/updateRequestDon.js` script and update the `subscriptionId` variable with your Chainlink Functions subscription ID.

1. Fund your Functions subscription with at least 5 testnet LINK using the [Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager](https://functions.chain.link/).

1. Run the following script to update the `OffchainDataFetcher` Functions request with [DON-hosted Secrets](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/resources/secrets):

   ```bash
   node functions/updateRequestDon.js
   ```

   Expect output similar to the following in your terminal:

   ```bash
   Make request...
   Upload encrypted secret to gateways https://01.functions-gateway.testnet.chain.link/,https://02.functions-gateway.testnet.chain.link/. slotId 1. Expiration in minutes: 4320

   ✅ Secrets uploaded properly to gateways https://01.functions-gateway.testnet.chain.link/,https://02.functions-gateway.testnet.chain.link/! Gateways response:  { version: 1717010963, success: true }

   ✅ Automated Functions request settings updated! Transaction hash 0xfaafcfcbb42163679681d189af6e777b36df4ec7a6d2cf14aea6fe220be0899e - Check the explorer https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xfaafcfcbb42163679681d189af6e777b36df4ec7a6d2cf14aea6fe220be0899e
   ```

   **Note**: On testnets, DON-hosted secrets have a maximum Time to Live (TTL) of 72 hours. If you need to extend the TTL beyond this period, consider using [secrets hosted in your own GitHub gists](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-use-secrets-gist) for your requests. For this approach, include your `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` in your `.env` file and use the `updateRequestGists.js` script instead of `updateRequestDon.js`.

1. Add your `OffChainDataFetcher` contract as a consumer in your Functions subscription ([Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager](https://functions.chain.link/)). **Note**: You can find your deployed `OffchainDataFetcher` contract address in `output/deployedOffchainDataFetcher.json`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a Time-based upkeep" number={3}>

1. Register an upkeep to call the `sendRequestCBOR` function on your `OffchainDataFetcher` contract daily:

   - Go to the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/).
   - Create a time-based upkeep that targets the `sendRequestCBOR` function.
   - To run the upkeep daily at 3 AM UTC, use the following CRON expression: `0 3 * * *`.
   - Set the gas limit to `1000000`.
   - Fund your upkeep with 5 testnet LINK.

   **Note**: You can find your deployed `OffchainDataFetcher` contract address in `output/deployedOffchainDataFetcher.json`.

1. Configure your contract so only the upkeep contract (and your admin account, which deployed the contract) can call the `sendRequestCBOR` function. This security measure is important to prevent anyone from calling several times `sendRequestCBOR` and draining your Functions subscription balance.

   - Go to [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io).
   - Enter your `OffchainDataFetcher` contract address in the search bar. **Note**: This address is available in `output/deployedOffchainDataFetcher.json`.
   - Select the `Contract` section, then click on the `Write Contract` tab.
   - Connect your admin account, which is the wallet you used to deploy the contract.
   - Call the `setAutomationCronContract` function with the `Upkeep address` as the input parameter. **Note**: You can find the `Upkeep address` in the Details section of your upkeep in the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/).

</Accordion>

## `AutomatedPortfolioManager` deployment and setup

<Accordion title="Deploy the contract" number={1}>

Run the following script to deploy your `AutomatedPortfolioManager` contract on Ethereum Sepolia:

```bash
forge script script/DeployAutomatedPortfolioManager.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL_SEPOLIA --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify -vvvv
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a custom upkeep" number={2}>

1. Go to the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/).

1. Create a new Custom logic upkeep with a starting balance of 5 testnet LINK. **Note**: You can find your deployed `AutomatedPortfolioManager` contract address in `output/deployedPortfolioManager.json`.

1. Configure your contract so only the upkeep contract (and your admin account, which deployed the contract) can call the `performUpkeep` function. This security measure is important to prevent anyone from calling several times `performUpkeep` and draining your Automation balance.

   - Go to [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io).
   - Enter your `AutomatedPortfolioManager` contract address in the search bar. **Note**: This address is available in `output/deployedPortfolioManager.json`.
   - Select the `Contract` section, then click on the `Write Contract` tab.
   - Connect your admin account, which is the wallet you used to deploy the contract.
   - In the function inputs, enter the `Forwarder address` into the `setAutomationUpkeepForwarderContract` function. **Note**: You can find the `Forwarder address` in the Details section of your upkeep in the [Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/).

</Accordion>

## Run the dApp locally

1. Navigate to the `app` folder:

   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the `app` directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
1. Open your `.env.local` file and add your Sepolia RPC URL:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url
   ```
   You can use the same RPC URL you used for contract deployment or get one from providers like [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).

1. Run the dApp locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` with your favorite browser.

1. Change tab to `My Investment`.

1. Connect your wallet.

1. Enter the amount of testnet USDC you want to invest and click `Invest`.

**Note**: The initial assets allocation is 40% mXAU, 30% mWBTC, and 30% mETH. You can wait until the next scheduled time-based upkeep at 3 AM UTC to fetch the latest data and make it available in your `OffchainDataFetcherContract`. Your custom upkeep will then automatically rebalance the portfolio. Alternatively, you can call the `sendRequestCBOR` function on your `OffchainDataFetcherContract` on [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) with your admin account to initiate the first rebalance.
