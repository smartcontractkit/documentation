## Overview

This API endpoint allows you to fetch historical prices from Chainlink price feeds for a specified period. The API endpoint returns the price data in JSON format. You can use this API endpoint to fetch historical prices for a single round or multiple rounds.

## Objective

This example shows you how to set up and run a pre-built API that reads historical price data from Chainlink Price Feeds. The API runs offchain, but reads the data from onchain [Chainlink Data Feeds](/data-feeds). You can use this API to build your own applications.

<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">

## Before you begin

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 14.x.x
- Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) >= 1.22.x

## Steps to implement

<Accordion title="Set up the project" number={1}>

1. Clone the [Historical Prices API](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-historical-prices-api.git) repo and change directories:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-historical-prices-api.git && cd quickstarts-historical-prices-api
   ```

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

After you complete the setup steps, you can access the UI at `http://localhost:3000`. The API is available at `http://localhost:3000/api/price`.

In order to fetch the price for a single round, you need to specify the same start and end timestamps. Make sure that the time frame exists. The API endpoint will return the price for the round that is within the specified time frame.

### Request a single-round

Make a simple `curl` request to test the API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/price?contractAddress=0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419&startTimestamp=1614556800&endTimestamp=1614556800&chain=mainnet&rpcUrl=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key
```

Response:

```json
{
  "description": "ETH/USD",
  "decimals": 8,
  "rounds": [
    {
      "phaseId": "1",
      "roundId": "1",
      "answer": "2000",
      "timestamp": "2021-03-01T00:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "phaseId": "1",
      "roundId": "2",
      "answer": "2100",
      "timestamp": "2021-03-01T01:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Request multiple rounds" number={3}>

In order to fetch the prices for multiple rounds, you need to specify different start and end timestamps. Make sure that the start timestamp is less than the end timestamp and that the time frames exist. The API endpoint will return the prices for the rounds that are within the specified time frame.

Make a simple `curl` request to test the API with multiple rounds returned:

```bash
GET /api/price?contractAddress=0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419&startTimestamp=1614556800&endTimestamp=1614643200&chain=mainnet&rpcUrl=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "description": "ETH/USD",
  "decimals": 8,
  "rounds": [
    {
      "phaseId": "1",
      "roundId": "1",
      "answer": "2000",
      "timestamp": "2021-03-01T00:00:00Z"
    },
    ⋮
    ⋮
  ]
}
```

## Reference

The endpoint for this API is `GET /api/price`.
