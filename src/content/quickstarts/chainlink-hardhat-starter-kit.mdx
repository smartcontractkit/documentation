## Overview

Several [Starter Kits](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/starter-kits/blob/main/README.md) are available for different smart contract development frameworks. These starter kits make it easy to get started with Chainlink services inside your Hardhat projects. This guide shows you how to install and configure the [Chainlink Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit).

## Objective

You will install and configure the Chainlink Hardhat starter kit so you can use it to integrate Chainlink services into your own smart contracts.

<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">
  This tutorial represents an example of using a Chainlink product or service and is provided to help you understand how
  to interact with Chainlink's systems and services so that you can integrate them into your own. This template is
  provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, has not been audited, and may be missing key
  checks or error handling to make the usage of the product more clear. Do not use the code in this example in a
  production environment without completing your own audits and application of best practices. Neither Chainlink Labs,
  the Chainlink Foundation, nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs that are generated due
  to errors in code.

## Before you begin

- If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract).
- If you are new to Hardhat, read the [Hardhat Getting Started documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/).
- Set up a cryptocurrency wallet such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and optionally install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

## Set up your environment

1. Clone the repository and change directories.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/ && cd hardhat-starter-kit
   ```

1. If you plan to use TypeScript, check out the TypeScript branch.

   ```
   git checkout typescript
   ```

1. Install the dependencies using either `npm` or `yarn`:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   ```
   yarn --install
   ```

1. Confirm that everything is configured correctly by running a test.

   ```
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Using the Starter Kit

After you install the starter kit, you can complete several different tasks. See the [Chainlink Hardhat Starter Kit Usage](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit#usage) guide for a list of examples of how the starter kit can be used to develop smart contracts integrated with Chainlink services.
