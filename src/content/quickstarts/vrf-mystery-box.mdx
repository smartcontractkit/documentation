## Overview

This is a template for NFT collection with a mystery box mechanic powered by [Chainlink VRF V2.5](https://docs.chain.link/vrf).

Smart contracts are based on the gas efficient [ERC721Psi](https://github.com/estarriolvetch/ERC721Psi). It's super easy to deploy and configure with most of the steps automated in the deploy script.

The key features of this template include:
- a private minting stage with a merkle tree
- rate limited batch minting
- delayed reveal with randomization technique to save gas
- provenance hash to verify the authenticity of the metadata
- royalties for secondary sales 
- configurable parameters

## Objective

You will use a Hardhat project to deploy an existing MysteryBox application on Ethereum Sepolia.

## Before you begin

<Aside type="note" title="New to smart contract development?">
  If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart
  Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract).
</Aside>

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- Set up a cryptocurrency wallet such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
- Fund your wallet with testnet ETH and LINK from [faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Run `git --version` to check the installation.
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 or later.
- Optionally, you can [install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) and use it to run this example instead of using `npm`.
- [Create an Etherscan API key](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) if you do not already have one. This is used to verify your contracts onchain.
- Create an account with [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) to obtain an RPC endpoint if you do not already have one.

<Accordion title="Configure the Hardhat project" number={3}>

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is an Ethereum development environment that is used here to configure and deploy the mystery box contract. You need the following information:

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | Example                                               |

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test the contracts locally" number={4}>

To run the unit tests, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

If you want to see gas usage, run the following command:

```bash
REPORT_GAS=true npm run test
```

For coverage reports, run the following command:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deploy the example contract" number={5}>

Run the `npx hardhat run` command and replace `<network>` with the network that you want to deploy to. The network must be configured in [`hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-mysterybox/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts).

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network <network>
```

In addition to deploying the contract, the deploy script also completes the following steps automatically:

1.  Create and fund a VRF V2.5 subscription if one is not provided. Make sure the deployer account has enough LINK to fund the subscription. The initial funding amount is configured in [`network-config.ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/quickstarts-mysterybox/blob/main/network-config.ts). For testnets, you can use the [LINK faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/) to get LINK. If your subscription is underfunded, your VRF request will be [pending](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui#pending) for 24 hours. If this happens, check the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) to see the additional balance needed.

1.  Add the deployed contract address as a consumer to the VRF subscription. If you provided a subscription ID, make sure the deployer account is the owner of the subscription. Otherwise, comment out the `addConsumerToSubscription` function in the deploy script and add the contract address manually.

1.  Generate a [Merkle tree](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/merkle-proofs-for-offline-data-integrity/#introduction) for the allowlist. The merkle tree is generated from the address list in `scripts/data/whitelist.json` file.

1.  Verify the contract on Etherscan. This is important to show users the source code for the contract so they can confirm how it works. It's also required to run the example yourself.

After the deployment is complete, the terminal prints the link to view your contract on Etherscan.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Run the example" number={6}>

After the contract is deployed, run the example using contract functions on Etherscan.

1. Open the Etherscan link from your terminal to view your contract.
1. On the **Contract** tab, click the **Write Contract** tab to view your contract's write functions.
1. Click **Connect to Web3** to connect your wallet to Etherscan so you can run the functions.
1. Enable public minting:
1. Open the `setPublicMint` function.
1. Enter a value of `true`.
1. Click **Write** to run the function. Approve the transaction in MetaMask.
1. Mint an NFT to test the contract:
1. Open the `publicMint` function.
1. Enter a `publicMint` value of `0.01` ETH and an amount of `1`.
1. Click **Write** to run the function. Approve the transaction in MetaMask.
1. Reveal the box:
1. Open the `reveal` function.
1. Click `reveal` to reveal the mystery box.
1. After the reveal, you can find the NFT in the token list for your externally owned account (EOA).
