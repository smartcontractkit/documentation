## Overview

This tutorial shows how to create, manage, fund and batch migrate [Chainlink Automation](https://automation.chain.link) upkeeps using [FlashLiquidity](https://www.flashliquidity.finance/)'s [Automation Station](https://github.com/flashliquidity/flashliquidity-automation/tree/main).

## Objective

In this tutorial, you will deploy the [AutomationStation contract](https://github.com/flashliquidity/flashliquidity-automation/blob/main/contracts/AutomationStation.sol) and use it to manage your upkeeps.

<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">
  This tutorial represents an example of using a Chainlink product or service and is provided to help you understand how
  to interact with Chainlink's systems and services so that you can integrate them into your own. This template is
  provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, has not been audited, and may be missing key
  checks or error handling to make the usage of the product more clear. Do not use the code in this example in a
  production environment without completing your own audits and application of best practices. Neither Chainlink Labs,
  the Chainlink Foundation, nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs that are generated due

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract).
- Set up a cryptocurrency wallet
- To deploy this contract on testnets, ensure the deployer account has testnet ERC-677 LINK. Use the [LINK faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/) to retrieve testnet LINK.
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Steps to implement

<Accordion title="Install the dependencies" number={1}>

Clone the source and install the required packages:

1. Install [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

1. Clone the `flashliquidity-automation` repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/flashliquidity/flashliquidity-automation.git && \
    cd flashliquidity-automation
    ```

1. Install the other package dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn setup
    ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deploy and fund the AutomationStation contract" number={2}>

1. Compile the contract:

    ```sh
    yarn compile
    ```

1. Deploy `AutomationStation.sol`, passing the following parameters to the constructor:

  - `i_linkToken`: The [LINK token address](/resources/link-token-contracts) for the network you're using.
  - `s_registerUpkeepSelector`: The function selector of the registrar's `registerUpkeep` function.
  - `s_registrar`: The address of the Automation registrar
  - `s_refuelConfig`: The `RefuelConfig` that specifies how much and how often to refuel your Automation Station
      ```
      RefuelConfig({
            refuelAmount: refuelAmount,
            stationUpkeepMinBalance: stationUpkeepMinBalance,
            minDelayNextRefuel: minDelayNextRefuel
        });
      ```

1. Initialize and fund the AutomationStation upkeep by calling its `initialize` function.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add upkeeps to monitor" number={3}>

1. Use the `addUpkeeps` function to add a list of existing upkeeps for your Automation Station to monitor.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use batch functions" number={4}>

You can run the following functions to modify a batch of existing upkeeps:

- `pauseUpkeeps`
- `unpauseUpkeeps`
- `withdrawUpkeeps`
- `migrateUpkeeps`

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dismantle the Automation Station" number={5}>

1. Remove all the upkeeps that the Automation Station upkeep is monitoring, by using the `removeUpkeep` function. This function removes one upkeep at a time from the station's watchlist.

1. When all upkeeps are removed from the station's watchlist, you can call the `dismantle` function.
