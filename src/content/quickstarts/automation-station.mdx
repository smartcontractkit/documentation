## Objective

In this tutorial, you will deploy the [AutomationStation contract](https://github.com/flashliquidity/flashliquidity-automation/blob/main/contracts/AutomationStation.sol) and register it as an upkeep. This main station upkeep monitors the balances for all your other upkeeps and funds them when the balances are too low. The repo includes convenience scripts to help you run each AutomationStation function from the command-line.

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract).
- Set up a cryptocurrency wallet such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
- To deploy this contract on testnets, ensure the deployer account has testnet ERC-677 LINK. Use the [LINK faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/) to retrieve testnet LINK.
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Steps to implement

<Accordion title="Install the dependencies" number={1}>

Clone the source and install the required packages:

1. Install [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), or update it to the latest version by running `foundryup -v`.

1. Clone the `flashliquidity-automation` repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/flashliquidity/flashliquidity-automation.git && \
    cd flashliquidity-automation
    ```

1. Install the other package dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn setup
    ```

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` at the root of the directory:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

1. In the .env file, set your private key and the RPC URL for the network you're using.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deploy the AutomationStation contract" number={2}>

Deploy the AutomationStation contract to an Automation supported network by setting parameters
within a deployment script, and then running the deployment script.

1. Navigate to the `scripts/deployStation.ts` file to find the deployment script.
1. Edit the deployment script, filling in the required parameters for the `AutomationStation` constructor. Make sure to format each value as a string.

    At minimum, you need to fill in these two parameters:
    - `linkToken`: The address of the ERC-677 compatible LINK token. For this example, you can use the address for Arbitrum Sepolia (`'0xb1D4538B4571d411F07960EF2838Ce337FE1E80E'`) or see [all the LINK token addresses for other networks](/resources/link-token-contracts). (If you're using bridged LINK for certain networks, the LINK may not be ERC-677 compatible. Use the [Chainlink Pegswap service](https://pegswap.chain.link/) to convert Chainlink tokens to be ERC-677 compatible before funding the station).
    - `registrar`: The address of the Chainlink Automation registrar for the [selected network](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks). (For Arbitrum Sepolia, the registrar address is `'0x881918E24290084409DaA91979A30e6f0dB52eBe'`.)

    The following parameters have default values in the script. Check that the settings related to refueling upkeeps and minimum balances make sense for your usage, and update them if necessary:
    - `registerUpkeepSelector`: The Chainlink Automation Registrar 4-byte [function selector](/resources/glossary#function-selector) of `registerUpkeep`, which stays the same across different networks. Leave this at its default value: `'0x3f678e11'`.
    - `refuelAmount`: The amount of LINK tokens that the AutomationStation adds to an underfunded upkeep's balance. (Default value: `'1000000000000000000'` or 1 LINK)
    - `stationUpkeepMinBalance`: The minimum balance of LINK tokens for the main station upkeep. If the balance falls below this threshold, the main station upkeep is considered underfunded. (Default value: `'1000000000000000000'` or 1 LINK)
    - `minDelayNextRefuel`: The minimum delay time in seconds between consecutive refuels of the same upkeep (main station upkeep excluded). (Default value: `'600'` or 10 minutes)
    - `approveAmountLINK`: The initial allowance of LINK tokens to the Chainlink Automation Registrar. (Default value: `'100000000000000000000'` or 100 LINK)
1. Save your changes to the `scripts/deployStation.ts` file.
1. Run the deployment script:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/deployStation.ts --network arbitrum_sepolia
    ```

You can view the supported networks for the deployment scripts inside the Hardhat configuration file (`hardhat.config.ts`) and add any required network if it is missing.

After you've run the deployment script successfully, the output shows the address of your AutomationStation contract:

```sh
Compiled 15 Solidity files successfully (evm target: paris).
AutomationStation deployed to: 0x794Db242b1d75663E2d821B0105cFd4E5Bb182F0
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fund and initialize the AutomationStation" number={3}>

After deploying the `AutomationStation` contract, you need to fund the station contract before initializing it as an upkeep. During the initialization process, the main station upkeep is registered. This upkeep monitors all your other registered upkeeps to ensure they are not underfunded; if they are, it adds funds to their balance.

1. Send LINK to the contract address for your deployed AutomationStation. ([Get testnet LINK](https://faucets.chain.link) if needed, and see [how to fund your contract in MetaMask](/resources/fund-your-contract#send-funds-to-your-contract).)
1. Navigate to the `scripts/initializeStation.ts` file to find the initialization script.
1. Edit the initialization script, filling in the following required parameters to register your deployed AutomationStation contract as an upkeep on Chainlink Automation:
    - `registry`: The address of the Chainlink Automation Registry for the [selected network](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks). This parameter is optional; if you set it now, the Automation forwarder of the station will be automatically set during initialization. Otherwise, you must set the forwarder before registering other upkeeps.
    - `registrationParams`: The encoded [registration parameters](/chainlink-automation/guides/register-upkeep-in-contract#register-the-upkeep) for the main station upkeep. The `adminAddress` and `upkeepContract` need to be the station's contract address. An example of how to encode the registration parameters is provided inside the script.
1. Save your changes to the `scripts/initializeStation.ts` file.
1. Run the initialization script:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/initializeStation.ts --network arbitrum_sepolia
    ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Register new upkeeps" number={4}>

Once initialized, the station's `registerUpkeep` function can be used to register a new Chainlink Automation upkeep. The station monitors the newly registered upkeep to ensure that the upkeep meets the minimum LINK token balance required for execution. If the balance falls below this threshold, the station uses its own LINK token balance to increase the upkeep balance until it meets the required minimum.

To register a new upkeep, edit the necessary parameters inside `scripts/registerUpkeep.ts` and run the script.

1. Navigate to the `scripts/registerUpkeep.ts` file to find the upkeep registration script.
1. Fill in the encoded `registrationParams`.
    - The `adminAddress` must be the address of the station itself. 
    - The station's LINK token balance must be greater than or equal to the amount you set in the `amount` parameter.
    - The allowance of LINK tokens to the Chainlink Automation Registrar must also be greater than or equal to   the `amount`.
1. Run the upkeep registration script:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/registerUpkeep.ts --network arbitrum_sepolia
    ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add existing upkeeps for balance monitoring" number={5}>

Use the `addUpkeeps` function to add a list of existing upkeeps for your AutomationStation to monitor. This function does not directly modify any of your upkeeps in Chainlink Automation; instead, it adds upkeep IDs to the AutomationStation's `s_upkeepIds` list, which is then used for balance monitoring. 

1. Navigate to the `scripts/addUpkeeps.ts` file.
1. Fill in the address of your deployed AutomationStation contract and the list of upkeep IDs for the station to monitor.
1. Save your changes to the `scripts/addUpkeeps.ts` file.
1. Run the script:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/addUpkeeps.ts --network arbitrum_sepolia
    ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Manage batches of upkeeps" number={6}>

Unlike the `addUpkeeps` function, which simply updates the AutomationStation's internal list of upkeeps for balance monitoring, these functions modify batches of upkeeps on Chainlink Automation:

- `pauseUpkeeps` - Pauses a specified list of upkeeps
- `unpauseUpkeeps` - Unpauses a specified list of upkeeps
- `withdrawUpkeeps` - Withdraws LINK from a specified list of canceled upkeeps
- `migrateUpkeeps` - Migrates a specified list of upkeeps to a newer registry

To use these functions:

1. Navigate to the corresponding file in the `scripts` directory. For `pauseUpkeeps`, go to `pauseUpkeeps.ts`. 1. Fill in the station address and the list of upkeep IDs that you want to manage.
1. Save your changes to the script file.
1. Run the script:

    ```
    npx hardhat run scripts/pauseUpkeeps.ts --network arbitrum_sepolia
    ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dismantle the Automation Station" number={7}>

1. Remove all the upkeeps that the Automation Station upkeep is monitoring, by using the `removeUpkeep` function. This function removes one upkeep at a time from the station's watchlist.

1. When all upkeeps are removed from the station's watchlist, you can call the `dismantle` function.

</Accordion>
