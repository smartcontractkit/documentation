# Acquire testnet LINK
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/acquire-link

The Getting Started guides show you how to send ETH on the Sepolia testnet, but some contracts might require you to use LINK token instead. This page shows you how to obtain testnet LINK and send it to your MetaMask wallet.

## Configure MetaMask to use LINK tokens

To see your LINK token balance in MetaMask, you must manually add the token.

1. Open up MetaMask.

2. At the bottom of the MetaMask windows, click **Import tokens**.

3. Find the LINK token contract address for the network that you want to use. On Sepolia, the LINK token address is: `0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789`. See the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page to find the addresses for different testnets.

4. Paste the token contract address into MetaMask in the Token Address input. The token symbol and decimals of precision will auto-populate.

   (Image: Metamask Custom Tokens Screen)

5. Click **Next**. A new window will appear, showing the LINK token details.

6. Click **Import Tokens** to confirm adding the new token.

MetaMask should now display the new LINK token balance.

## Get testnet LINK from a faucet

1. Go to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/).
2. In MetaMask, select the network where you want to receive testnet LINK.
3. Click **Connect wallet** so the faucet app can detect the network and wallet address.
4. If you want to receive testnet funds at a different address, paste it in the **Wallet address** section. This field defaults to your connected wallet address.
5. In the **Request type** section, select the testnet funds that you want to receive.
6. Complete the Captcha and click **Send request**. The funds are transferred from the faucet to the wallet address that you specified.

After the transaction is confirmed onchain, the faucet app shows "Request complete" and the transaction hash of your request.

# Cross-chain bridges and associated risks
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/bridge-risks

When working with Chainlink on layer-2 chains and sidechains, you must export your LINK tokens from Ethereum to the target chain using a cross-chain bridge. Follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKvIGkBWRUA) for an example of moving LINK tokens from Ethereum to Polygon.

Cross-chain bridges come with their own risks. In fact, bridge attacks constitute some of the [largest cryptocurrency hacks](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) by value. When moving your LINK tokens or any asset across chains, understand the risks that you are taking with your assets. Chainlink Labs does not endorse any bridge. Ultimately, you are responsible for assessing the bridge that you use to move your assets.

Read the [What is a cross-chain bridge](#what-is-a-cross-chain-bridge), [Trade-offs](#trade-offs), and [Risks](#risks) sections to learn more about bridges and trust assumptions in their designs. After you read these sections, you will have a better understanding of bridge risks and which aspects you should evaluate when using a bridge.

## What is a Cross-chain bridge

With the [proliferation](https://defillama.com/chains) of layer-1 blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions, the web3 ecosystem has become multi-chain. Each blockchain comes with its own approach to scalability, security, and trust.

However, blockchains are not natively capable of communicating with each other, which makes [blockchain interoperability protocols](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-interoperability/) critical for allowing dApps to interact with any onchain network and tap into each blockchain's unique assets and features.

A [bridge](https://blog.chain.link/cross-chain-bridge/) is a core element of cross-chain interoperability. Bridges exist to connect blockchain networks and enable connectivity between them.

Bridges enable the following:

- Cross-chain transfer of assets and information
- dApps can leverage the strengths and benefits of different chains
- Collaboration between developers from different blockchain ecosystems to build new platforms and products for users

As an analogy, you can use [the blockchains as cities mental model](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/blockchains-are-cities-564327013f86):

- Layer-1 blockchains are like cities.
- Layer-2 solutions are equivalent to skyscrapers. As described in the mental model, “Each rollup is like a vertical blockchain that extends from the ground L1”.
- Bridges are like roads and streets that connect different cities and skyscrapers.

## Trade-offs

With the growing number of layer-1 and layer-2 chains, the number of bridges has also grown, [surpassing one hundred](https://debridges.com/). So, how do you choose the correct bridge?

When choosing a bridge, there is no perfect solution, only trade-offs. As explained in the [interoperability trilemma](https://blog.connext.network/the-interoperability-trilemma-657c2cf69f17) and [Ethereum foundation docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/bridges/#trade-offs), bridge designs must compromise between the following characteristics:

- **Trust-minimization:** The system does not introduce new trust or security assumptions beyond those of the underlying blockchains. Read [trust-minimization for more details](#trust-minimization-counterparty-risk).
- **Generalizability:** The system enables the transfer of complex arbitrary data. Data could be messages or assets/funds.
- **Extensibility:** How hard is it to integrate a new blockchain?
- **Latency:** How long does it take to complete a transaction?
- **Costs:** How much does it cost to transfer data across chains via a bridge?

## Risks

When choosing a bridge, be aware of the following risks.

### Smart contract risks

Bugs and vulnerabilities can expose users' assets to different kinds of exploits. Read this [detailed analysis](https://certik.medium.com/qubit-bridge-collapse-exploited-to-the-tune-of-80-million-a7ab9068e1a0) for an example of a bridge exploit where the attacker could leverage a logical error in the bridge’s smart contract.

### Systemic financial risks

To transfer tokens cross-chain, many bridges lock tokens on the source chain and mint derivative or wrapped tokens on the destination chain representing the locked tokens. A hack of the locked tokens or an infinite mint attack on the wrapped tokens can make all wrapped tokens worthless and expose entire blockchains to risk.

### Early stage

Given that bridges are relatively new, there are many unanswered questions related to how bridges will perform in different market conditions.

### Trust-minimization (Counterparty risk)

To overcome cross-chain interoperability challenges, some bridges use offchain actors or validators. These actors introduce new trust assumptions in addition to the underlying blockchain trust assumptions. These bridges act as a custodian and are, therefore, trust-based.
In contrast, some bridge designs rely on underlying blockchains' validators and, therefore, do not add any trust assumptions.
To summarize:

- Trusted (custodial) bridges require a third party to validate movements over the bridge. Users are required to give up control of their crypto assets, so trust is involved as they rely on the bridge operator's reputation.
- Trustless (non-custodial) bridges leverage smart contracts to store and release funds on either side of the bridge. These bridges are trust-minimized because they don't make new trust assumptions beyond the underlying blockchains.

Trustlessness in bridges does not exist in an absolute form (trusted vs. trustless). As explained in the blockchain-interoperability [blog](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-interoperability/), there are four general interoperability solutions for validating the state of a source blockchain and relaying the subsequent transaction to the destination blockchain:

#### Web2 Verification

Web2 verification is when someone uses a web2 service to execute a cross-chain transaction. The most common example in practice is when users leverage centralized exchanges to swap or bridge their own tokens. The user simply deposits their assets into an address on the source chain that's under the control of the exchange and then withdraws the same tokens or different tokens (via a swap on the exchange) to an address on a destination chain controlled by the user.

Web2 verification can be fairly convenient for personal transactions and requires less technical expertise. However, it is limited only to swapping and bridging tokens which requires trust in a centralized custodian.

#### External verification

External verification is where a group of validator nodes are responsible for verifying transactions. These validators do not belong to either of the two blockchains’ validator sets and they also have their trust assumptions irrespective of the underlying blockchains.

External verification typically requires an honest majority assumption, where a majority of the external validator nodes must behave honestly for the integrity of the cross-chain interaction to be upheld. However, additional techniques can be used to increase trust-minimization, such as:

- Optimistic bridge verification
- Risk management networks
- Cryptoeconomic staking

Despite an additional trust assumption, external verification is currently the only practical way to perform cross-chain contract calls between certain types of blockchains while still providing trust-minimized guarantees. It’s also a highly generalized and extensible form of cross-chain computation that is capable of supporting more complex cross-chain applications.

<Aside type="note" title="Cryptography risk">
  Some externally verified bridges are secured by multisig wallets.
  [Ronin](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain) is one example. Multisig wallets are
  also referred to as m-of-n multisigs, with M being the required number of signatures or keys and N being the total
  number of signatures or keys (m≤n). This means that an attacker only needs to exploit M keys to be able to hack the
  whole system. In this case, users must trust that the third party is decentralized enough, signers are independent of
  each other, and that each signer has proper key management in place. Read this [detailed
  analysis](https://rekt.news/ronin-rekt/) for an example of a bridge exploit where the attacker could compromise M
  keys.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Optimistic bridges">
  Optimistic bridges rely on honest watchers to monitor the bridges' operations and report any risks. Because the
  watchers of an optimistic system are permissionless, there is no way to know if there is not at least one single
  watcher monitoring the system. Therefore, the cost of a successful attack is limitless as it requires an attacker to
  know who the watchers are and hack all of them.
</Aside>

Here are some examples of externally verified bridges that use different techniques to increase trust-minimization :

- [Binance bridge](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/introducing-binance-bridge-20-421499824684903626) is a trusted bridge using the security standards of Binance.
- [Polygon POS bridge](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started/) uses a proof of stake (PoS) consensus algorithm for network security.
- [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/nomad-101/introduction) is an optimistic bridge. It uses [optimistic verification](https://docs.nomad.xyz/the-nomad-protocol/verification-mechanisms/optimistic-verification) where messages are optimistically signed on the origin chain and a timeout period is enforced on the destination. During this period, a set of actors called watchers can inspect the messages and flag any detected risks.

#### Local verification

Local verification is when the counterparties in a cross-chain interaction verify the state of one another. If both deem the other valid, the cross-chain transaction is executed, resulting in peer-to-peer cross-chain transactions. Cross-chain swaps using local verification are often referred to as atomic swaps.

This model has a high level of trust-minimization given reasonable blockchain assumptions, as the swap either happens or both transactions fail. Furthermore, the model works so long as both parties are economically adversarial: they cannot collude to steal funds during atomic swaps.

Note that local verification is not very generalizable to a variety of cross-chain contract calls, and comes with tradeoffs like the [inadvertent call option problem](https://blog.bitmex.com/atomic-swaps-and-distributed-exchanges-the-inadvertent-call-option/) — a situation where the second party in an atomic swap can either act or not act on the swap, giving them an inadvertent call option for a certain period of time. Thus, local verification is mostly used in cross-chain liquidity protocols involving liquidity pools that exist independently on each chain.

[Hop](https://docs.hop.exchange/faq#what-is-hop-protocol) or Connext Legacy are examples of locally verified bridges.

#### Native verification

In this design, the validators of the destination blockchains are responsible for verifying the state of the source blockchain to confirm a given transaction. This is typically done by running a light client of the source chain in the virtual machine of the destination chain or running them both side-by-side. Native verification is the most trust-minimized form of cross-chain communication, but it is more expensive, offers less development flexibility, and is more suited to blockchains with similar state machines, such as between Ethereum and EVM-based layer-2 networks or only among Cosmos SDK-based blockchains.

The [NEAR Rainbow Bridge](https://near.org/blog/eth-near-rainbow-bridge/) is an example of a natively verified bridge. A smart contract with Ethereum light client functionality is deployed on the NEAR blockchain and a smart contract with NEAR protocol light client functionality is deployed on Ethereum. These light clients hold the latest block headers and verify that cross-chain transactions are done across both chains. The trust model relies only on Ethereum and Near validators.

On top of these awesome things, contributing to open source is fun. It can give you a sense of community involvement, and gives you a personal sense of satisfaction knowing that you're part of an effort to build something that will enable a fairer, more transparent, and efficient new world.

## Contributing to software and tooling

The most direct way you can contribute to Chainlink is to contribute to the core code or the various tooling found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/). Contributing to code or code-based tools can generally be split into a few different categories:

- Raising an issue
- Requesting a new feature
- Submitting a Pull Request (PR) for a fix, improvement, or new tool

### Raising an issue

During the course of using Chainlink software or tools, you might encounter errors or unexpected behavior that leads you to believe the software isn't behaving correctly. You can bring this to the attention of the Chainlink Labs team as well as the wider developer community by raising an issue in the project’s GitHub repository. The 'Issues' tab lists all of the open issues for the repository.

After an issue is raised and tagged, the Chainlink Labs team and the wider community can address it. This gives the issue the visibility required for someone to investigate it and resolve the issue.

When you first create an issue, you must also categorize it. This prefixes the issue name to give viewers an indication of what category the issue relates to:

- [NODE]: The issue relates to the core node software
- [DEVEL]: The issue is a result of working on code found in the current repository
- [FEAT]: The issue relates to a new feature request
- [SMRT]: The issue related to using Chainlink smart contracts
- [EXPL]: The issue related to using the Chainlink Explorer
- [FAUC]: The issue related to using the Chainlink Faucet

(Image: Selecting the new issue category)

After you select a category, enter the details for the issue. Include as much detail about the issue as possible. Provide a thorough description, environment, and software version details. Also provide detailed steps that describe how to reproduce the issue. The more thorough you make your description, the better the chances are that someone will be able to pick up the issue and resolve it.

Once a team member acknowledges that the issue has been received, they will tag it with an appropriate label. You should then monitor the state of the open issue for any questions or updates.

### Requesting a new feature

Have you thought of an improvement or an awesome new feature that you think should be implemented into Chainlink? Request a new feature to bring it to the attention of the team and the wider community. You can request new features by creating a new GitHub issue in the correct repository and tagging that issue with the [FEAT] prefix (Feature request). The process for doing this is covered in the [Raising an Issue](#raising-an-issue) section. Provide as much detail as possible in your feature request, including any benefits, risks, or considerations that you can think of.

#### Voting on new features

Sometimes a new feature is put to a vote to decide if it's something that the team and wider community should implement. When a feature is put to a vote, the issue is tagged with the 'needs votes' label. You can contribute to the voting process by reacting to the first post in the feature request with a thumbs up or thumbs down emoji. This will help drive the decision. You can also contribute your thoughts by replying directly to the feature request with a new post in the thread.

(Image: Voting on a new feature request)

### Submitting a pull request

The best way to contribute to Chainlink is to submit a [pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). PRs can be submitted for various reasons, such as fixing an identified issue, adding a feature or improvement to the project, or even adding an entirely new repository to the Chainlink source code for a new tool or feature. If you're looking for something to pick up and create a PR for, you can search through the Chainlink repositories to find open issues, and approved feature requests.

If you're new to contributing to open-source software or Chainlink, we've tagged some [good first issues](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) against the main node software and smart contracts that you can tackle. Each major repository in the Chainlink GitHub should also have some good first issues tagged for developers to be able to take on.

All code changes must follow the [style guide] ([https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/wiki/Code-Style-Guide](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/wiki/Code-Style-Guide)), All PRs must be in an appropriately named branch with a format like 'feat/feature-description' or 'devel/issue-description'. After you submit a PR, you should get a response by a team member within a day or two acknowledging that the PR has been received. After that, monitor the PR for any additional questions or updates that come up while the team and the community review the changes.

## Contributing to the documentation

The [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/) is the go-to place for developers who want to learn how to build applications using Chainlink, and node operators wanting useful information on running a Chainlink node.

# Fund Your Contracts
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/fund-your-contract

Some smart contracts require funding at their addresses so they can operate without you having to call functions manually and pay for the transactions through MetaMask. This guide explains how to fund Solidity contracts with LINK or ETH.

## Retrieve the contract address

1. In Remix, deploy your contract and wait until you see a new contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
2. On the left side panel, use the **Copy** button located near the contract title to copy the contract address to your clipboard.

## Send funds to your contract

1. Open MetaMask.
2. Select the network that you want to send funds on. For example, select the Sepolia testnet.
3. Click the **Send** button to initiate a transaction.
4. Paste your contract address in the address field.
5. In the **Asset** drop down menu, select the type of asset that you need to send to your contract. For example, you can send LINK. If LINK is not listed, follow the guide to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
6. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount of LINK that you want to send.
7. Click **Next** to review the transaction details and the gas cost.
8. If the transaction details are correct, click **Confirm** and wait for the transaction to process.

<Aside type="caution" title="Transaction fee didn't update?">
  You may need to click **Fastest**, **Fast**, **Slow**, or **Advanced Options** after entering the **Amount** to update the gas limit for the token transfer to be successful.

# Getting Help
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/getting-help

If you run into issues and the available documentation, videos, and code repositories are not able to assist you, the best way to get help is to follow the support escalation process in this document. Sometimes you might have a question that is too theoretical or hasn't been solved, so you might not always get what you're looking for!

## Double check the documentation

Check to see if you missed any code, documentation, blog, or video on the topic or issue you're looking for. There are typically a few different resources on a topic if one doesn't answer exactly what you're looking for. You can also use the documentation search bar to look up things as well.

## Do a web search for the specific error or situation you're in

Often someone else has asked the same question that you're asking. If you copy and paste the error into the Google or web search bar, there is a good chance that you will find some helpful material from someone else who has already found the solution to your question.

## Open an issue on GitHub or the code repository

This is only applicable if you're working with a certain set of code. For example, if you're having an issue working with the [Chainlink Hardhat Starter kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit), open an issue on the repo explaining exactly what's going on and someone might have the answer that you need.

When writing issues, remember to:

- Keep titles short
- Be clear and concise about the issue that you are encountering
- Format your issue description. Use [three backticks (\`\`\`)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-format-code-in-markdown/#code-blocks) to format your code or log output.
- Always add any and all associated code
- Don't use screenshots. Screenshots are not searchable and generally make it harder to understand your issue.

## Ask a question on Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange Ethereum

This is where most people will end up and is one of the most helpful resources out there. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=chainlink) is living documentation, so do your best to make a [thoughtful and easy to triage question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). This will make it much easier for people to help debug your issue and ensure it doesn't get removed from the site. Remember, we want to make this question **searchable** so others who run into the same issue can also get their question solved. You could use any forum-based site you like if you prefer another site over Stack Overflow, such as [Stack Exchange Ethereum](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/).

It's best to create a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help others understand your issue. This way, they can help you get an answer quickly. Remember, it's a community-run platform! Don't get discouraged if your question gets downvoted or removed. This just means you need to format your question a little differently next time!

**An example of a poorly formatted question:**

Title: Please help

I'm following this guide, and my code is breaking, what's going on?

[https://docs.chain.link/](https://docs.chain.link/)

Here is my code

```
pragma solidity 0.6.7; contract HelloWorld { string public message; constructor(string memory initialMessage) {message = initialMessage; }`
```

**The same question with better formatting:**

Title: Remix Solidity Compile Error - Source File Requires Different Compiler Version

I'm [following this guide](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract), and I'm unable to compile my solidity code in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Here is the code:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.6.7;

contract HelloWorld {
  string public message;

  constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
    message = initialMessage;
  }

  function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
    message = newMessage;
  }
}
```

And the error I'm getting is as follows:

```
ParserError: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.Emscripten.clang) - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
--> contracts/test.sol:1:1:
|
1 | pragma solidity 0.6.7;
| ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```

## Ask the community

You can always ask the question in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2YHSAey) and see if there is a community member who might be able to help you out. One of the best ways to ask the community is to drop a link to your Stack Overflow question, issue, or the forum where you're asking a Chainlink question. Remember, these are community members, and they are helping because they are wonderful and kind individuals!

For important updates regarding the use of Chainlink Price Feeds, users should join the official Chainlink Discord and subscribe to the data-feeds-user-notifications channel: [https://discord.gg/Dqy5N9UbsR](https://discord.gg/Dqy5N9UbsR)

# Glossary
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/glossary

### Adapter

<Aside type="danger" title="">
  The adapters or JSON adapters for v1 Jobs are removed for Chainlink nodes running version 1.0.0 and later. Use [v2 job
  tasks](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/tasks) instead.
</Aside>

An adapter or [task](#task) is a piece of software responsible for executing a specific piece of functionality. A Chainlink node comes with a number of Adapters built-in, commonly known as Core Adapters, but can also be extended via [Bridges](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/node-operators) to connect with user-defined [External Adapters](#external-adapter).

### Answer

The result produced from an oracle service, after all safety checks and aggregations have been performed.

### Bridge

Bridge is the connection between a Chainlink node and an [External Adapter](#external-adapter). The External Adapter runs as a separate [service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture), and a Bridge facilitates communication between the node and one of these adapters.

If you would like to add a new External Adapter to your node, you create a new Bridge either in the GUI or the CLI. Within the Chainlink node, a bridge must have a unique name, but can share the same URL with other bridges. You can also set a different number of default confirmations for each bridge, and an additional payment amount. Once the bridge is added to the node, its name can then be used as a task type in [Jobs](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs).

### Consumer (Contract)

Recipient of an [Answer](#answer) provided by an [Oracle](#oracle). The Consumer is commonly a contract, and is also commonly the same [entity that requested the Answer](#requester), but does not have to be. We have a helper function, ` addExternalRequest`, that gives consuming contracts the ability to safely check answers it receives without requesting them itself.

### Encumbrance parameters

Encumbrance parameters are the part of a [service agreement](#service-agreement) that can be enforced onchain. Information on encumbrance parameters can be found <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/wiki/Service-Agreements-and-the-Coordinator-Contract" target="_blank">on our Wiki</a>.

### External adapter

[External adapters](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/wiki/External-Adapters) are what make Chainlink easily extensible, providing simple integration of custom computations and specialized APIs.

A Chainlink node communicates with external adapters by sending a POST request with a JSON data payload. More information can be found on the external adapter [page](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters).

### Function selector

A [function selector](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html#function-selector) specifies the function to be called in Ethereum. It is the first four bytes of the call data for a function call in an Ethereum transaction. Solidity contracts have a built-in helper method to access the function selector by using `this.myFunction.selector`, where `myFunction` is a non-overloaded function in the contract.

### Initiator

<Aside type="danger" title="">
  The initiators for v1 Jobs are removed for Chainlink nodes running version 1.0.0 and later. Use the [v2 job
  types](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs) instead.
</Aside>

Triggers the execution of a [Job Spec](#job-spec).

### Job

Short-hand for a [Job Spec](#job-spec).

### Job run

The Job Run is the artifact documenting the outcome of executing a [Job](#job). The Job Run is made up of a [Task](#task) and a [Run Result](#run-result) representing the ultimate outcome of the Job Run.

### JobID

The ID associated to a given [Job Spec](#job-spec). This will be unique per-node, even with the same contents within the spec itself.

### Job spec

The [Job Specification](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs) is the specification of a piece of work to be completed by an Oracle Node. The Job Spec is made up of two main parts:

- The [Task Type](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs#shared-fields) or the [External Initiator](/chainlink-nodes/external-initiators/external-initiators-introduction): Defines the ways a Job can be triggered to execute.
- The [Task list](#task-spec): The `tasks` that specify all of the computation steps to perform when executing a Job Spec. The Task list is sometimes referred to as the [Job Pipeline](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/tasks/#writing-pipelines) because all of the Tasks' operations are performed in order, with the result being fed into the next task.

### Oracle

Entity which connects computations on blockchains with offchain resources. Typically made up of two components: the [Oracle Node](#oracle-node) (offchain) and the [Oracle Contract](#oracle-contract) (onchain).

### Oracle contract

The onchain component of an [Oracle](#oracle). The Oracle Contract is the interface through which [Consuming Contracts](#consumer-contract) pass and receive data with offchain resources.

### Oracle node

The offchain component of an [Oracle](#oracle).

### Phase

For data feeds, a phase indicates the underlying aggregator implementation has been updated. Phases are relevant only for the EACAggregatorProxys. You can think of a roundId on the proxies as a large number containing data for two numbers (phaseId + roundId). The roundId is pulled from the aggregator's implementation and combined by bit shifting with the latest phaseId of the proxy.

### Requester

A Smart Contract or Externally Owned Account which requests data from an [Oracle](#oracle). The Requester does not have to be the same entity as the [Consumer](#consumer-contract) but commonly is the same.

### Run result

A Run Result is the result of executing a [Job Spec](#job-spec).

### Run status

Each [Job Run](#job) has a status field indicating its current progress. The Run Status can be in one of the [following states](https://godoc.org/github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/core/store/models/#pkg-constants):

- Unstarted
- In Progress
- Pending Confirmations
- Pending Bridge
- Pending Sleep
- Errored
- Completed

### SAID

The ID associated with a given [Service Agreement](#service-agreement).

### Service agreement

The Service agreement consists of a [Job Spec](#job-spec) and a set of [encumbrance parameters](#encumbrance-parameters) that is shared among a creator and multiple Chainlink nodes. Information on service agreements can be found [on our Wiki](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/wiki/Service-Agreements-and-the-Coordinator-Contract).

### Spec

Another short-hand for a [Job Spec](#job-spec).

### Task

A v2 job [task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/tasks).

### Task spec

The Task Spec is the definition for an individual task to be performed within the [job specification](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs) by a specific adapter. The Task Spec always includes a `type` field which specifies which [adapter](#adapter) will execute it. Optionally, a Task Spec can specify additional `params` which will be passed on to its adapter, and `confirmations` which specify how many confirmations a [Task Run](#task-run) needs before executing.

### Task run

The result of the individual [Task Spec](#task-spec)'s execution. A Task Run includes the Task Spec that it used for input and the [Run Result](#run-result) which was the output of the execution.

# LINK Token Contracts
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts

***

<Aside type="note" title="Talk to an expert">
  <a href="https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=Contracts">Contact us</a> to talk to an expert about the networks that
  support the LINK token.
</Aside>

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

<Aside type="note" title="Interfaces and Applications">
  Chainlink CCIP is a messaging protocol. Third parties may build user interfaces or other applications on top of CCIP.
  Neither Chainlink Labs nor the Chainlink Foundation owns, controls, endorses, or assumes any responsibility for any
  such interfaces or applications. You are solely responsible for your use of such interfaces or applications. Please
  visit the Chainlink Foundation [Terms of Service](https://chain.link/terms) for more information.

### OP Sepolia Testnet

Testnet ETH is used to pay for transactions on OP Sepolia. Use the [OP Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) to transfer testnet ETH from Ethereum Sepolia to OP Sepolia. Testnet ETH is available at [faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).

Testnet Native and LINK is available at [faucets.chain.link/optimism-sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/optimism-sepolia). Testnet bridges might not transfer the correct type of LINK to OP Sepolia, so it is recommended to use only the LINK acquired from [faucets.chain.link/optimism-sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/optimism-sepolia) when developing applications on testnet.

### Polygon Mainnet

POL is used to pay for transactions on Polygon. You can use the [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/) to transfer tokens to Polygon Mainnet and then use [Polygon Gas Swap](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/gas-swap/) to swap supported tokens to POL.

<Aside type="caution" title="ERC-677 LINK on Polygon">
  The LINK provided by the <a href="https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/">Polygon Bridge</a> is not ERC-677
  compatible, so you cannot use it with Chainlink services or oracle nodes. Use the{" "}

  {" "}

  to convert bridged LINK to the official ERC-677 LINK token on Polygon.

# Integrating EVM Networks With Chainlink Services
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/network-integration

Before an EVM blockchain network can integrate with Chainlink, it must meet certain technical requirements. These requirements are critical for Chainlink nodes and Chainlink services to function correctly on a given network.

<Aside type="note" title="Disclaimer">
  The standard EVM requirements required to integrate EVM blockchain networks with Chainlink services can vary, are
  subject to change, and are provided here for reference purposes only. Chainlink services may have unique requirements
  that are in addition to the requirements discussed herein.
</Aside>

## Standard EVM requirements

### Solidity global variables and opcode implementation

Solidity global variables and opcode implementation constructs must meet the following requirements in order for Chainlink services to operate correctly and as expected:

- **Global variables:** Support all global variables as specified in the Solidity [Block and Transaction Properties](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties) documentation. For example, the following variables must be supported:
  - `block.blockhash` must return the hash of the requested block for the last 256 blocks
  - `block.number` must return the respective chain's block number
  - `block.chainID` must return the current chain ID
  - `block.timestamp` must return the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch
- **Opcodes:** Support all opcodes and expected behaviors from the [OpCodes.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/tests/solidity/contracts/OpCodes.sol) contract
- **Precompiles:** Must support all precompile contracts and expected behaviors listed in the Solidity [Mathematical and Cryptographic Functions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions) documentation
- **Contract size:** Must support the maximum contract size defined in [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170)
- **Nonce:** The transaction nonce must increase as transactions are confirmed and propagated to all nodes in the network.

### Finality

Blockchain development teams must ensure that blocks with a commitment level of *finalized* are actually final. The properties of the finality mechanism, including underlying assumptions and conditions under which finality violations could occur, must be clearly documented and communicated to application developers in the blockchain ecosystem.

Furthermore, this information should be accessible through RPC API tags *finalized* from the [JSON-RPC specification tags](#support-the-ethereum-json-rpc-specification) described later in this document.

### Standardized RPCs with SLAs

Chainlink nodes use RPCs to communicate with the chain and perform soak testing. It is not possible to ensure the functionality of Chainlink services if RPCs are unstable, underperforming, or nonexistent. RPCs must meet the following requirements:

**Dedicated RPC node:**

- The chain must provide instructions and hardware requirements to set up and run a full node.
- The archive node setup must also be provided and allow queries of blocks from genesis with transaction history and logs.
- The RPC node must enable and allow configurable settings for the following items:
  - Batch calls
  - Log lookbacks
  - HTTPS and WSS connections

**RPC providers:**

- Three separate independent RPC providers must be available.
- RPC providers must ensure there is no rate limit.
- RPC providers must have a valid SSL certificate.
- During the trailing 30 days, the RPC providers must meet the following RPC performance requirements:
  - Uptime: At least 99.9%
  - Throughput: Support at least 300 calls per second
  - Latency: Less than 250ms
  - Support SLA: For SEV1 issues, provide a Time to Answer (TTA) of at most 1 hour

### Support the Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification

The chain must support the [Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc). Chainlink services use several methods to operate on the chain and require a specific response format to those calls in line with the JSON RPC standard of Ethereum. If a response does not match this required format, the call fails and the Chainlink node will stop functioning properly.

The following methods are specifically required and must follow the [Ethereum RPC API specification](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/):

- [GetCode](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getcode)
- [Call](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_call)
- [ChainID](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_chainid)
- [SendTransaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_sendtransaction)
- [SendRawTransaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_sendrawtransaction)
- [GetTransactionReceipt](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactionreceipt)
- [GetTransactionByHash](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactionbyhash)
- [EstimateGas](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_estimategas)
- [GasPrice](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gasprice)
- [GetTransactionCount](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactioncount)
- [GetLogs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getlogs)
  - Must follow the spec as defined in [EIP-1474](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1474.md?plain=1#L856). The "latest" block number returned by `GetBlockByNumber` must also be served by `GetLogs` with logs.
  - Must accept the `blockhash` param as defined in [EIP-234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-234.md)
- [GetBalance](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getbalance)
- [GetBlockByNumber](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getblockbynumber)
- [GetBlockByHash](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getblockbyhash)

The above RPC methods must have the expected request and response params with expected data types and values as described in the [Execution-api spec](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/tests) and [Ethereum RPC API Spec](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/).

The network must also support the following items:

- **Subscription Methods:** [Websocket JSON-RPC subscription methods](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/pubsub)
  - `eth_subscribe` with support for subscription to `newHeads` and `logs`
- **Tags:** The RPC methods must support the `finalized`, `latest`, and `pending` tags where applicable. They must also support natural numbers for blocks.
- **Batch Requests:** Must support batching of requests for the `GetLogs` and `GetBlockByNumber` methods.
- **Response size:** Any RPC request including the batch requests must be within the allowed size limit of around 173MB.

### `eth_sendRawTransaction` error message mapping to Geth client error messages

Chains must provide an error message mapping between their specific implementation to the error messages detailed below.

When the `eth_sendRawTransaction` call fails, Chainlink nodes must be able to recognize these error categories and determine the next appropriate action. If the error categories are different or cannot be mapped correctly, the Chainlink node will stop functioning properly and stop sending transactions to the chain. The following error messages are specifically critical:

| Error                               | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NonceTooLow`                       | Returned when the nonce used for the transaction is too low to use. This nonce likely has been already used on the chain previously.                             |
| `NonceTooHigh`                      | Returned when the nonce used for the transaction is higher than what the chain can use right now.                                                                |
| `ReplacementTransactionUnderpriced` | Returned when the transaction gas price used is too low. There is another transaction with the same nonce in the queue, with a higher price.                     |
| `LimitReached`                      | Returned when there are too many outstanding transactions on the node.                                                                                           |
| `TransactionAlreadyInMempool`       | Returned when this current transaction was already received and stored.                                                                                          |
| `TerminallyUnderpriced`             | Returned when the transaction's gas price is too low and won't be accepted by the node.                                                                          |
| `InsufficientEth`                   | Returned when the account doesn't have enough funds to send this transaction.                                                                                    |
| `TxFeeExceedsCap`                   | Returned when the transaction gas fees exceed the configured cap by this node, and won't be accepted.                                                            |
| `L2FeeTooLow`                       | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. Returned when the gas fees are too low, When this error occurs the Suggested Gas Price is fetched again transaction is retried.  |
| `L2FeeTooHigh`                      | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. Returned when the total fee is too high. When this error occurs the Suggested Gas Price is fetched again transaction is retried. |
| `L2Full`                            | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. The node is too full, and cannot handle more transactions.                                                                       |
| `TransactionAlreadyMined`           | Returned when the current transaction was already accepted and mined into a block.                                                                               |
| `Fatal`                             | Return when something is seriously wrong with the transaction, and the transaction will never be accepted in the current format.                                 |

For examples of how other chains or clients are using these categories, see the [error.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/error.go) file in the [go-ethereum repo](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) on GitHub.

For chains with zk-proofs, chains must reject transactions that cause zk-proof overflow with a uniquely identifiable error message.

Any other reasons why transactions might be rejected by a node or sequencer other than malformed input/gasLimits must be detailed.

### Clarify use of transaction types

For [transaction types](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/types/transaction.go#L48-51) other than `0x0 - Legacy`, `0x1 - Access List`, `0x2 - Dynamic`, and `0x3 - Blob`, networks must clarify how each transaction type is used. Chainlink nodes must know if the chain uses other types for regular transactions with regular gas so it can correctly estimate gas costs.

### Multi-signature wallet support

The chain must provide a supported and audited multi-signature wallet implementation with a UI.

### Block explorer support

The chain must provide a block explorer and support for contract and verification APIs.
