Welcome to the Hardhat Chainlink Plugin Documentation page.

New to Hardhat? Check the [Official Hardhat Documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs).

New to Chainlink? Check the [Official Chainlink Documentation](https://docs.chain.link/).

## Installation

```console
npm install @chainlink/hardhat-chainlink

# or

yarn add @chainlink/hardhat-chainlink
```

Import the plugin in your `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
require("@chainlink/hardhat-chainlink")
```

Or, if you are using TypeScript, in your `hardhat.config.ts`:

```ts
import "@chainlink/hardhat-chainlink"
```

## Environment extensions and Hardhat tasks

This plugin extends the Hardhat Runtime Environment by adding a `chainlink` field
whose type is `ExampleHardhatRuntimeEnvironmentField`. To use it, import in your tests/scripts/tasks the `chainlink` field from `hardhat`:

```typescript
import { chainlink } from "hardhat"

// or

const { chainlink } = require("hardhat")
```

This plugin comes with predefined Hardhat tasks for interacting with the local Chainlink Node. To see the available tasks, run the following command:

```console
npx hardhat
```

## Denominations library

This plugin comes up with the predefined [Denominations library](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/Denominations.sol). This library is available for you to fetch currency identifiers that lack a canonical Ethereum address.

#### Example

```typescript
import { chainlink } from "hardhat"

const ethDenomination = chainlink.denominations.ETH // 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE
const usdDenomination = chainlink.denominations.USD // 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000348
```

Here is the list of all available currency identifiers available in the Denominations library:

## Chainlink Functions

Chainlink Functions provides your smart contracts with access to a trust-minimized compute infrastructure. Your smart contract sends your code to a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON), and each DON’s oracle will run the same code in a serverless environment. Finally, the DON aggregates all the independent runs and returns the final result to your smart contract. Your code can be anything from a simple computation to fetching data from API providers.

Chainlink Functions do not require your consumer contracts to hold LINK tokens and send them to oracles when making requests. Instead, you must create a subscription account and fund it to pre-pay for your Chainlink Functions requests.

## Chainlink Data Feeds

Chainlink Data Feeds are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to the real-world data such as asset prices, reserve balances, and L2 sequencer health. Data feeds provide many different types of data for your applications:

- **Price Feeds**
  Chainlink Data Feeds are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to the real-world market prices of assets. List of Price Feed Contract Addresses is available [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses).

- **Proof of Reserve Feeds**
  Proof of Reserves feeds provide the status of reserves for stablecoins, wrapped assets, and real world assets. Proof of Reserve Feeds operate similarly to Price Feeds, but provide answers in units of measurement such as ounces (oz) or number of tokens. List of Proof of Reserve Feed Addresses is available [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/proof-of-reserve/addresses).

- **NFT Floor Pricing Feeds**
  NFT Floor Pricing Feeds provide the price of the lowest priced NFT available in a collection. List of NFT Floor Pricing Feed Addresses is available [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses).

- **L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds**
  L2 sequencer feeds track the last known status of the sequencer on an L2 network at a given point in time. This helps you prevent mass liquidations by providing a grace period to allow customers to react to these events. List of L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds is available [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds).

Returns the previous round id of a base/quote pair given a specified round using Chainlink's Feed Registry. Note that rounds are non-monotonic across phases.

The Chainlink Feed Registry is an on-chain mapping of assets to feeds. It enables you to query Chainlink data feeds from asset addresses directly, without needing to know the feed contract addresses. They enable smart contracts to get the latest price of an asset in a single call, from a single contract.

```typescript
public async getPreviousRoundId(
    feedRegistryAddress: string,
    base: string,
    quote: string,
    roundId: BigNumber
  ): Promise<BigNumber>;
```

- Parameters:

  - `feedRegistryAddress` - The Address of [Chainlink's Feed Registry](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/feed-registry/) Contract.
  - `base` - The Base Asset Address.
  - `quote` - The Quote Asset Address.
  - `roundId` - The Round ID.

- `RETURN`: The previous round id of a base/quote pair.

### getNextRoundId

Returns the next round id of a base/quote pair given a specified round using Chainlink's Feed Registry. Note that rounds are non-monotonic across phases.

The Chainlink Feed Registry is an on-chain mapping of assets to feeds. It enables you to query Chainlink data feeds from asset addresses directly, without needing to know the feed contract addresses. They enable smart contracts to get the latest price of an asset in a single call, from a single contract.

```typescript

## Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)

Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability. For each request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

## Running a Chainlink Node on a Hardhat Network

Operating a Chainlink node allows you to be part of the Chainlink Network, helping developers build hybrid smart contracts, giving them access to real-world data and services. Using a set of Hardhat tasks from this plugin, you can easily spin up a Chainlink Node locally and test your smart contracts against it.

#### Prerequisites

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version > 16.X
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version > 7
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

To view the list of all available tasks, enter the following command:

```console
npx hardhat
```

### chainlink:run-node

Open the Docker Desktop and run the Hardhat node by typing `npx hardhat node`.

Spins up a Chainlink node, which will set-up some predefined env variables. Please do not start it from the Docker Desktop.

```console
npx hardhat chainlink:run-node
```

> **Note**
>
> IMPORTANT!
>
> Each time this command runs, it will remove all containers and re-create them (before running `docker compose up`, we first run `docker compose down`)
>
> This behavior is analogous to the hardhat EVM node losing all previous history each time it is restarted.
>
> If you want to restart, only pass an additional `true` parameter (`restartOnly`) like this `npx hardhat chainlink:run-node true`

If you visit http://127.0.0.1:6688 in your browser, you should see the Chainlink node login page displayed.

You can use the following credentials to log in to your local Chainlink node:

- username - **user@hardhatchainlink.io**
- password - **strongpassword777**

### TROUBLESHOOTING

If you turn off the hardhat node all history will get wiped. In that case, you will also need to run the chainlink node again using the `chainlink:run-node` command.

If the chainlink node becomes out of sync (info not updating) then you can run `chainlink:run-node true` which will restart the node without destroying the containers.

Take note of the External ID of the Job.
