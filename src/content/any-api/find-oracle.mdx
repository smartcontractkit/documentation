This page explains how to find an existing Oracle Job to suit the needs of your API call.

## Introduction to Oracles

Oracles enable smart contracts to retrieve data from the outside world. Each oracle node can be configured to perform a wide range of tasks depending on the adapters it supports. For example, if your contract needs to make an HTTP GET request, it needs to use an oracle that supports the HTTP GET adapter.

Oracles [jobs](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs) can be specialized even further by implementing the configuration using [External Adapters](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters). For example, an Oracle job could implement URL, parameters, and conversion to Solidity compatible data, to retrieve a very specific piece of data from a specific API endpoint. This process is demonstrated in [Make an Existing Job Request](/any-api/get-request/examples/existing-job-request).

## Find a job

### Community node operators

To find an Oracle Job that is pre-configured for your use case and available on the right network, join the [Chainlink operator-requests discord channel](https://discord.gg/eGcxsdZzKR) to directly communicate with community node operators.

### Alternatives on testnet

On testnet, several alternatives are provided:

- The Chainlink Development Relations team maintains [Testnet Oracles](/any-api/testnet-oracles) that you can use to test implementations. If you don't find a suitable job for your needs, join [Chainlink operator-requests discord channel](https://discord.gg/eGcxsdZzKR) or check the other alternatives below.
- Run your own testnet nodes as explained [here](/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node). You must write your own [jobs](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs): To help you get started, each [ANY API tutorial](/any-api/get-request/introduction) has a corresponding job attached to it.
