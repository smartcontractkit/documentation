This guide explains how to make an HTTP GET request to an external API, that returns a _json_ array, from a smart contract, using Chainlink's [Request & Receive Data](/any-api/introduction) cycle and then receive the needed data from the array.

<AnyApiCallout callout="prerequisites" />

## Example

This example shows how to:

- Call an API that returns a JSON array.
- Fetch a specific information from the response.

[Coingecko _GET /coins/markets/_ API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) returns a list of coins and their market data such as price, market cap, and volume. To check the response, you can directly paste the following URL in your browser `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1&sparkline=false` or run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1&sparkline=false' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The response should be similar to the following:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json
[
  {
    "id": "bitcoin",
    "symbol": "btc",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "image": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1/large/bitcoin.png?1547033579",
    "current_price": 42097,
    "market_cap": 802478449872,
    ...
  },
  {
    ...
  }
]
```

Fetch the _id_ of the first element. To consume an API, your contract must import [ChainlinkClient.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/ChainlinkClient.sol). This contract exposes a struct named `Chainlink.Request`, which your contract can use to build the API request. The request must include the following parameters:

- Link token address
- Oracle address
- Job id
- Request fee
- Task parameters
- Callback function signature

<Aside type="caution" title="Note on Funding Contracts">

Making a GET request will fail unless your deployed contract has enough LINK to pay for it. **Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link) and [Fund your contract](/resources/fund-your-contract)**.

<CodeSample src="samples/APIRequests/FetchFromArray.sol" />

To use this contract:

1. Open the [contract in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/APIRequests/FetchFromArray.sol).

1. Compile and deploy the contract using the Injected Provider environment. The contract includes all the configuration variables for the _Sepolia_ testnet. Make sure your wallet is set to use _Sepolia_. The _constructor_ sets the following parameters:

   - The Chainlink Token address for _Sepolia_ by calling the [`setChainlinkToken`](/any-api/api-reference/#setchainlinktoken) function.
   - The Oracle contract address for _Sepolia_ by calling the [`setChainlinkOracle`](/any-api/api-reference/#setchainlinkoracle) function.
   - The `jobId`: A specific job for the oracle node to run. In this case, the _id_ is a _string_ data type, so you must call a job that calls an API and returns a _string_. We will be using a generic **_GET>string_** job that can be found [here](/any-api/testnet-oracles/#jobs).

1. Fund your contract with 0.1 LINK. To learn how to send LINK to contracts, read the [Fund Your Contracts](/resources/fund-your-contract) page.

1. Call the `id` function to confirm that the `id` state variable is not set.

1. Run the `requestFirstId` function. This builds the `Chainlink.Request` using the correct parameters. The `req._add("path", "0,id")` request parameter tells the oracle node to fetch the id at index 0 of the array returned by the GET request. It uses [JSONPath expression](https://jsonpath.com/) with comma `,` delimited string for nested objects, for example: `'0,id'`.

1. After few seconds, call the `id` function. You should get a non-empty response: _bitcoin_
