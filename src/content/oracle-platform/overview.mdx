import { ClickToZoom } from "@components"

The Chainlink stack consists of four open standards for designing and operating oracle services, covering data oracles, interoperability oracles, compliance oracles, and privacy oracles. Developers and institutions leverage these oracle services to address specific use case requirements of advanced blockchain applications or to support end-to-end solutions.

## Data Standard

The Chainlink data standard, powered by the Onchain Data Protocol (ODP); an open, protocol-level specification for how a DON aggregates and verifies external data and publishes it onchain.

Learn more about the [Chainlink Data Standard](/oracle-platform/data-standard).

## Interoperability Standard

The Chainlink interoperability standard, powered by the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP); an open, protocol-level specification for how a DON reads data on a source blockchain, verifies it, and writes it on a destination blockchain.

Learn more about the [Chainlink Interoperability Standard](/oracle-platform/interoperability-standard).

## Compliance Standard

The Chainlink compliance standard, powered by the Onchain Compliance Protocol (OCP); an open, protocol-level specification defining how to utilize DONs to define and store compliance data onchain and utilize identity data and policies in smart contracts.

Learn more about the [Chainlink Compliance Standard](/oracle-platform/compliance-standard).

## Privacy Standard

The Chainlink privacy standard utilizes privacy oracles to conceal sensitive data and provide confidential computing via CRE. It also includes multiple other Chainlink services, including DECO, Blockchain Privacy Manager, and CCIP Private Transactions.
