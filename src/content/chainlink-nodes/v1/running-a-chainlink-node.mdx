This guide will teach you how to run a Chainlink node locally using [Docker](#using-docker). The Chainlink node will be configured to connect to the Ethereum Sepolia.

<Aside type="note" title="Running from source">
  To run a Chainlink node from source, use the [following
  instructions](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink#install). However, it's recommended to run the Chainlink
  node with Docker. This is because we continuously build and deploy the code from our repository on Github, which means
  you don't need a complete development environment to run a node.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Supported networks">
  Chainlink is a blockchain agnostic technology. The [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page details networks which support the LINK token. You can set up your node to provide data to any of these blockchains.

Ganache is a mock testnet. Although you can run nodes on Ganache, it is not officially supported. Most node operators
should use one of the supported [testnets](/resources/link-token-contracts) for development and testing.

</Aside>

## Requirements

- As explained in the [requirements page](/chainlink-nodes/resources/requirements), make sure there are enough resources to run a Chainlink node and a PostgreSQL database.
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You will run the Chainlink node and PostgreSQL in Docker containers.
- Chainlink nodes must be able to connect to an Ethereum client with an active websocket connection. See [Running an Ethereum Client](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client) for details. In this tutorial, you can [use an external service](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client/#external-services) as your client.

## Using Docker

### Run PostgreSQL

1. Run PostgreSQL in a Docker container. You can replace `mysecretpassword` with your own password.

   ```shell
   docker run --name cl-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
   ```

1. Confirm that the container is running. Note the `5432` port is [published](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) `0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp` and therefore accessible outside of Docker.

   ```shell
   docker ps -a -f name=cl-postgres
   ```

   If the container is running successfully, the output shows a healthy status:

   ```shell
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
   dc08cfad2a16   postgres   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   cl-postgres
   ```

### Run Chainlink node

#### Configure your node

1.  Create a local directory to hold the Chainlink data:

                <Fragment slot="tab.1">Sepolia</Fragment>
                <Fragment slot="panel.1">
                ```shell Sepolia
                mkdir ~/.chainlink-sepolia
                ```
                </Fragment>
            </Tabs>

1.  Run the following as a command to create a `config.toml` file and populate with variables specific to the network you're running on. For a full list of available configuration variables, see the [Node Config](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config) page.
    Be sure to update the value for `CHANGEME` to the value given by your [external Ethereum provider](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client/#external-services).

              [[EVM.Nodes]]
              Name = 'Sepolia'

              ```
              </Fragment>

          </Tabs>

1.  Create a `secrets.toml` file with a keystore password and the URL to your database. Update the value for `mysecretpassword` to the chosen password in [Run PostgreSQL](#run-postgresql). Specify a complex keystore password. This will be your wallet password that you can use to unlock the keystore file generated for you.

          </Tabs>

            <Aside type="tip" title="Important">
              Because you are testing locally, add `?sslmode=disable` to the end of your `DATABASE_URL`. However you should _never_
              do this on a production node.
            </Aside>

1.  Optionally, you can create an `.api` file with the credentials for the node's API and Operator Interface. The node stores the credentials from the `.api` file in the database only the first time you run the container using the database. The `.api` file cannot override credentials for an existing user in the database.

    Create the file in the same directory as your TOML config files and list your API credentials. Change the values for API email and password. The user must be an email address with an `@` character and the password must be 16-50 characters in length.

1.  Start the Chainlink Node by running the Docker image.

    Change the version number in `smartcontract/chainlink:2.20.0` with the version of the Docker image that you need to run. For most new nodes, use version `2.0.0` or later. Tag versions are available in the [Chainlink Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcontract/chainlink/tags). _The `latest` version does not work._

    Chainlink Nodes running `2.0.0` and later require the `-config` and `-secrets` flags after the `node` part of the command.

    If you created an `.api` file with your API and Operator UI login credentials, add `-a /chainlink/.api` to the end of the `docker run` command. Otherwise, the node will ask you for these credentials when you start it for the first time. These credentials are stored in the database only when you run a container for the first time against that database. If you need to remove the `.api` file, delete the container, and start it again without `-a /chainlink/.api`.

1.  Detach from the container by pressing the Ctrl+P command and then the Ctrl-Q command. On MacOS, use ⌘-P and ⌘-Q.

1.  Confirm that the container is running. Note that the `6688` port is [published](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) `0.0.0.0:6688->6688/tcp` and is accessible outside of Docker.

    ```shell
    docker ps -a -f name=chainlink
    ```

    If the container is running, the output shows a healthy status:

    ```shell
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS                                       NAMES
    867e792d6f78   smartcontract/chainlink:2.20.0   "chainlink node -con…"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:6688->6688/tcp, :::6688->6688/tcp   chainlink
    ```

1.  You can now connect to your Chainlink node's UI interface by navigating to [http://localhost:6688](http://localhost:6688). Use the API
    credentials you set up earlier to log in.

    If you are using a VPS, you can create an [SSH tunnel](https://www.howtogeek.com/168145/how-to-use-ssh-tunneling/) to your node for `6688:localhost:6688` to enable connectivity to the GUI. Typically this is done with `ssh -i $KEY $USER@$REMOTE-IP -L 6688:localhost:6688 -N`. An SSH tunnel is recommended over opening public-facing ports specific to the Chainlink node. See the [Security and Operation Best Practices](/chainlink-nodes/resources/best-security-practices) page for more details about securing your node.

## Configure users and roles

You can create several users with different [role-based access tiers](/chainlink-nodes/v1/roles-and-access). This allows you to grant access to several users without granting admin privileges to every user. Role-based access can be configured only by using the CLI.

1. Open an interactive bash shell on the container that is running your node:

   ```shell
   docker exec -it chainlink /bin/bash
   ```

1. Log into the Chainlink CLI. The CLI prompts you for the admin credentials that you configured for your node.

   ```shell
   chainlink admin login
   ```

1. Add a user with view-only permissions on the node. The CLI prompts you for the new user's credentials.

   ```shell
   chainlink admin users create --email=operator-ui-view-only@test.com --role=view
   ```

   This user can now log into the UI and query the API, but cannot change any settings or jobs.

1. Confirm the current list of users:

   ```shell
   chainlink admin users list
   ```

1. Log out of the CLI. This prevents users with access to the shell from executing admin commands.

   ```shell
   chainlink admin logout
   ```

1. Exit from the container.

   ```shell
   exit
   ```

To learn how to modify user roles and see the full list of available roles, read the [Role-Based Access Control](/chainlink-nodes/v1/roles-and-access) page.
