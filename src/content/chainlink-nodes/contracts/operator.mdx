Oracles must deploy an onchain contract to handle requests made through the LINK token (Read [Basic Request Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model) to learn more).

When the _Basic Request_ model was introduced, node operators had to deploy the legacy [Oracle contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.4/Oracle.sol). However, these come with some limitations, and soon, we introduced [operator contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol).

<Aside type="note">
  <p>Node operators must use _Operator.sol_ instead of _Oracle.sol_.</p>
</Aside>

In addition to replacing oracle contracts, operator contracts come with additional features that add more security and flexibility for node operators.

## Features

### Multi-word response

In the EVM architecture, a word is made up of 32 bytes. One limitation of the [Oracle.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.4/Oracle.sol) contract is that it limits responses to requests to 32 bytes.

[Operator.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol) doesn't have the same limitation as it supports a response made of multiple EVM words.

### Factory deployment

To deploy an _Oracle_ contract, each node operator has to manually compile and deploy [Oracle.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.4/Oracle.sol).
The vast number of Solidity versions and steps involved in verifying the contract made it difficult for a client to verify that the deployed contract had not been tampered with.
To fix this, node operators can use a [factory](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/operatorfactory) to deploy an instance of the _operator_ contract. Moreover, the factory exposes a getter for clients to check if it deployed a specific _operator_ contract address.

### Distributing funds to multiple addresses

A common pain point of node operators is keeping their addresses funded. _Operator_'s `distributeFunds` method allows node operators to fund multiple addresses in a single transaction.

### Flexibility and security

By using multiple externally-owned accounts (EOAs) on Chainlink nodes and [forwarder](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/forwarder) contracts, node operators can set up different transaction-sending strategies.

<Aside type="note">
  <p>Read more about [forwarders](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/forwarder).</p>
</Aside>

As discussed in the [forwarder](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/forwarder) contracts page:

- Chainlink nodes' EOAs are hot wallets that fulfill requests.
- These EOAs can be associated with one or multiple [forwarder](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/forwarder) contracts. The forwarder's owner must whitelist them to call the [forward](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/forwarder#forward) function. One operator contract owns one or multiple forwarder contracts.
- Node operators manage their forwarder contracts through operator contracts. They use a secure wallet such as hardware or a multisig wallet as the operator's owner account.

## API reference

The operator contract inherits [AuthorizedReceiver](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/AuthorizedReceiver.sol) and [ConfirmedOwnerWithProposal](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/access/ConfirmedOwnerWithProposal.sol). Read [AuthorizedReceiver](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/receiver) and [ConfirmedOwnerWithProposal](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/ownership) API references.

### Methods

#### oracleRequest

<Aside type="note" title="Legacy">
  Use `operatorRequest` [function](#operatorrequest) instead.
</Aside>

```solidity
function oracleRequest(address sender, uint256 payment, bytes32 specId, address callbackAddress, bytes4 callbackFunctionId, uint256 nonce, uint256 dataVersion, bytes data) external
```

Creates the Chainlink request. This is backwards compatible API with [Oracle.sol contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.4/Oracle.sol), but the behavior changes because `callbackAddress` is assumed to be the same as the request sender.

##### Parameters

| ------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| sender             | address | The sender of the request                      |

| data               | bytes   | The extra request parameters                   |

```
