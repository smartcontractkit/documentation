title: "Operator Factory"

The [factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1zZo4O_Ong) design pattern is a well know programming pattern: Rather than compiling and creating instances of a contract yourself, the _factory_ does it for you.
As explained in the [operator guide](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/operator), the `OperatorFactory` contract comes with these benefits:

- Node operators do not need to manually compile and deploy [operator](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/operator) or/and [forwarder](/chainlink-nodes/contracts/forwarder) contracts. They can deploy them directly from the factory. See the[deploynewoperator](#deploynewoperator), [deploynewforwarder](#deploynewforwarder), and [deploynewoperatorandforwarder](#deploynewoperatorandforwarder) functions.
- Clients can verify if the factory deployed a given contract. See the [created](#created) function.

#### deployNewOperator

```solidity
function deployNewOperator() external returns (address)
```

Creates a new operator contract with the msg.sender as owner. Emits `OperatorCreated` event.

#### deployNewOperatorAndForwarder

```solidity
function deployNewOperatorAndForwarder() external returns (address, address)
```

Creates a new operator contract with the msg.sender as the owner and a new forwarder with the operator as the owner. Emits:

- [AuthorizedForwarderCreated](#authorizedforwardercreated) event.

#### deployNewForwarder

```solidity
function deployNewForwarder() external returns (address)
```

Creates a new forwarder contract with the msg.sender as owner. Emits [AuthorizedForwarderCreated](#authorizedforwardercreated) event.

#### deployNewForwarderAndTransferOwnership

```solidity
function deployNewForwarderAndTransferOwnership(address to, bytes message) external returns (address)
```

Creates a new forwarder contract with the msg.sender as owner. Emits [AuthorizedForwarderCreated](#authorizedforwardercreated) event.

#### created

```solidity
function created(address query) external view returns (bool)
```

Indicates whether this factory deployed an address.

### Events

#### OperatorCreated

```solidity
event OperatorCreated(address operator, address owner, address sender)
```

#### AuthorizedForwarderCreated

```solidity
event AuthorizedForwarderCreated(address forwarder, address owner, address sender)
```
