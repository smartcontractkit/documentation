import { CodeSample } from "@components"

This is an example v2 (TOML) job spec for returning a _string_ in one Chainlink API Call. Note that the job calls the `fulfillOracleRequest2` function. If you are a node operator, use an [Operator contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol) with this job.
To test it from a smart contract, see this [Example](/any-api/get-request/examples/array-response).
