## Execute Commands Running Docker

In order to interact with the node's CLI commands, you need to be authenticated. This means that you need to access a shell within the Chainlink node's running container first. You can obtain the running container's `NAME` by running:

```shell
docker ps
```

The output will look similar to:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES
436882efd51d        smartcontract/chainlink   "./chainlink-launche…"   33 minutes ago      Up 21 minutes       6688/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6688->6688/tcp   chainlink
```

The last item, `chainlink`, is the name of the running container (using `--name chainlink` in your `docker run` command will give you a common name). Accessing a shell for this container is accomplished by running:

```shell
docker exec -it chainlink /bin/bash
```

This changes the prompt to something similar to:

```shell
root@436882efd51d:~#
```

You can now log in by running:

```shell
chainlink admin login
```

You will be prompted to enter your API Email and Password, and if successful, the prompt will simply appear again. You can check that you are authenticated by running:

```shell
chainlink jobs list
```

If no jobs have been added, you will receive the following output, otherwise, the list of added jobs will be returned:

```
╔ Jobs
╬════╬════════════╬════════════╬═══════╬
║ ID ║ CREATED AT ║ INITIATORS ║ TASKS ║
╬════╬════════════╬════════════╬═══════╬
```

## Transfer funds from node wallet.

<Aside type="note" title="Note for Docker">
  If using Docker, you will first need to follow the [Execute Commands Running Docker](#execute-commands-running-docker)
  guide to enter the running container.
</Aside>

To transfer funds from the node wallet to another address, use the following CLI command:

```shell
chainlink txs create <amount> <your-cl-node-address> <send-to-address>
```

This method is the preferred way to interact with your node wallet. Using other methods to manually interact with the node wallet can cause nonce issues.

## Change your API password

<Aside type="note" title="Note for Docker">
  If using Docker, you will first need to follow the [Execute Commands Running Docker](#execute-commands-running-docker)
  guide to enter the running container.
</Aside>

In order to change your password, you first need to log into the CLI by running:

```shell
chainlink admin login
```

Use your API email and old password in order to authenticate.

Then run the following in order to update the password:

```shell
chainlink admin chpass
```

It will ask for your old password first, then ask for the new password and a confirmation.

Once complete, you should see a message "Password updated."

## Multi-user and Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

See the [Roles and Access Control](/chainlink-nodes/v1/roles-and-access) page.

## Key management

In this section, ensure you log into the CLI by executing the following command:

```shell
chainlink admin login
```

Authenticate using your API email and password.

### List ETH keys

To list available Ethereum accounts along with their ETH & LINK balances, nonces, and other metadata, execute the following command:

```shell
chainlink keys eth list
```

Example:

```text
🔑 ETH keys
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Address:           0x2d4f5FBD00E5A4fD53D162cE7EDFdb5b7664C542
EVM Chain ID:      11155111
Next Nonce:        0
ETH:               0.000000000000000000
LINK:              0
Disabled:          false

Updated:           2023-04-26 08:12:51.340348 +0000 UTC
```

### Create a new ETH Key

To create a key in the node's keystore alongside the existing keys, run the following command:

```shell
chainlink keys eth create
```

Example:

```text
ETH key created.

🔑 New key
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Address:           0xd31961E1f62A2FaB824AC3C1A7a332daF8B11eE0

```

### Export an ETH key

To export an Ethereum key to a JSON file, run the following command:

```shell
chainlink keys eth export [address] [command options]
```

where:

- `address`: The EVM account address for which you want to export the private key.

- Options:
  - `--newpassword FILE, -p FILE FILE`: A file containing the password to encrypt the key.
  - `--output value, -o value`: The path where the JSON file will be saved.

Example:

```text
chainlink keys eth export 0xd31961E1f62A2FaB824AC3C1A7a332daF8B11eE0 --newpassword .chainlink/pass --output privatekey.json

🔑 Exported ETH key 0xd31961E1f62A2FaB824AC3C1A7a332daF8B11eE0 to privatekey.json
```

### Delete an ETH key

To remove an Ethereum key, run the following command:

```shell
chainlink keys eth delete [address] [command options]
```

where:

- `address`: The EVM account address that you want to remove.

- Options:
  - `--yes, -y`: Skip the confirmation prompt.

Example:

```text
$ chainlink keys eth delete 0xd31961E1f62A2FaB824AC3C1A7a332daF8B11eE0 --yes
Deleted ETH key: 0xd31961E1f62A2FaB824AC3C1A7a332daF8B11eE0
```

### Import an ETH key

To import an Ethereum key from a JSON file, run the following command:

```shell
chainlink keys eth import [JSON file] [command options]
```

where:

- `JSON file`: The path where the JSON file containing the ETH key is saved.

- Options:
  - `--oldpassword FILE, -p FILE`: FILE containing the password used to encrypt the key in the JSON file.
  - `--evmChainID value`: Chain ID for the key. If left blank, default chain will be used.

Example:

```text
$ chainlink keys eth import privatekey.json --oldpassword .chainlink/pass
