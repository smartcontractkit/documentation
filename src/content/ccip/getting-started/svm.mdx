## Solana (SVM) Support in CCIP

Chainlink CCIP supports Solana through the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling cross-chain interoperability between Solana and other blockchain families including EVM chains.

## What You Can Build with CCIP on Solana

- **Cross-Chain Token Transfers**: Transfer tokens from/to Solana
- **Cross-Chain Data Messaging**: Send arbitrary data between Solana programs and smart contracts on other chains
- **Programmable Token Transfers**: Combine token transfers with messaging to trigger specific actions on destination chains
- **Cross-Chain Token (CCT) Standard**: Enable your tokens in CCIP to be transferred to/from Solana
