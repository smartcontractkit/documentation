Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) provides a secure and reliable way to send messages, transfer tokens, and initiate actions across different blockchains.

## Available Platforms

CCIP supports multiple blockchain environments:

- **EVM**: Send messages and tokens between Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible networks
- **SVM**: Connect Solana with other chain families through CCIP

## What You Can Build with CCIP

- **Cross-Chain dApps**: Create applications that operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains
- **Token Bridges**: Transfer tokens between different blockchain networks
- **Cross-Chain Data Messaging**: Send arbitrary data between smart contracts on different chains
- **Programmable Token Transfers**: Combine token transfers with messaging to trigger specific actions on destination chains

## Getting Started Guides
