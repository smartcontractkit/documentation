## Aptos Support in CCIP

Chainlink CCIP supports Aptos, enabling cross-chain interoperability between the Aptos blockchain and other blockchain families, including EVM chains.

## What You Can Build with CCIP on Aptos

- **Cross-Chain Token Transfers**: Transfer tokens from/to Aptos.
- **Cross-Chain Data Messaging**: Send arbitrary data between Aptos modules and smart contracts on other chains.
- **Programmable Token Transfers**: Combine token transfers with messaging to trigger specific actions on destination chains.
- **Cross-Chain Token (CCT) Standard**: Enable your Fungible Asset tokens in CCIP to be transferred to/from Aptos.
