## Aptos Support in CCIP

Chainlink CCIP supports Aptos through the Move programming language, enabling cross-chain interoperability between Aptos and other blockchain families including EVM chains. The integration leverages Aptos's resource model and Fungible Asset standard to provide secure cross-chain token transfers and messaging.

## What You Can Build with CCIP on Aptos

- **Cross-Chain Token Transfers**: Transfer tokens from/to Aptos using the Fungible Asset standard
- **Cross-Chain Data Messaging**: Send arbitrary data between Aptos modules and smart contracts on other chains
- **Programmable Token Transfers**: Combine token transfers with messaging to trigger specific actions on destination chains
- **Cross-Chain Token (CCT) Standard**: Enable your tokens in CCIP to be transferred to/from Aptos
