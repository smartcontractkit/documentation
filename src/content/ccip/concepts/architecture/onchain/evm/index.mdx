Chainlink CCIP's EVM onchain architecture consists of a set of smart contracts deployed on both source and destination chains. These components work together with CCIP's offchain infrastructure to provide end-to-end cross-chain interoperability.

- **[Overview](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/evm/overview)**: Provides a high-level introduction to CCIP's onchain architecture, including a component diagram, key roles, and a detailed walk-through of a message's lifecycle from source to destination chain.

- **[Components](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/evm/components)**: Describes each architectural component in detail.

- **[Upgradability](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/evm/upgradability)**: Explains CCIP's approach to secure system evolution.
