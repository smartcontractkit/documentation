Chainlink CCIP's SVM onchain architecture consists of specialized Solana programs deployed on both source and destination chains. These components work together with CCIP's offchain infrastructure to provide end-to-end cross-chain interoperability.

- **[Overview](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/svm/overview)**: Provides a high-level introduction to CCIP's SVM-based architecture, including component diagrams, key roles, and a detailed walk-through of a message's lifecycle from source to destination chain.

- **[Components](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/svm/components)**: Describes each architectural component in detail.

- **[Upgradability](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/svm/upgradability)**: Explains CCIP's approach to secure system evolution.
