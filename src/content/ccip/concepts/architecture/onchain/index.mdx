This section details the onchain components of the CCIP architecture, covering both EVM-compatible chains and SVM-based chains such as Solana.

- **[EVM Architecture](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/evm)**: Learn about the onchain components specific to EVM environments.
- **[SVM Architecture](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/svm)**: Explore the onchain programs and components specific for SVM environments.
- **[Aptos Architecture](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/aptos)**: Understand the onchain components and message structures for Aptos environments.
