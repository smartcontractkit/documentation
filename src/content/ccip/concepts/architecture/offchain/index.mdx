This section describes the offchain components that support the CCIP network, ensuring security, reliability, and efficient cross-chain message processing.

- **[Overview](/ccip/concepts/architecture/offchain/overview)**: A high-level summary of the offchain systems, including Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs), the Risk Management Network, and node capabilities.
- **[Risk Management Network](/ccip/concepts/architecture/offchain/risk-management-network)**: Understand how this network monitors cross-chain activity for potential risks.
