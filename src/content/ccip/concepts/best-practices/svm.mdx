## CCIP Best Practices for SVM

The CCIP best practices guide for SVM-based blockchains like Solana is currently being developed. Check back soon for comprehensive guidance on:

- Secure cross-chain message design
- Token transfer optimization
- Account management considerations
- Error handling and recovery strategies

In the meantime, you can refer to the [CCIP SVM API Reference](/ccip/api-reference/svm/) for technical specifications.
