title: "Executing with a Multisig"

Rate limit changes are commonly executed from a **multisig wallet** to reduce operational risk and ensure changes are reviewed before being applied on-chain.

This page describes the high-level execution model for multisig-based updates and points to tooling that can be used to submit transactions safely.

## Why use a multisig

Managing CCIP rate limits directly affects cross-chain transfer availability. Using a multisig helps:

- require multiple reviewers before changes are executed
- reduce the risk of accidental misconfiguration
- provide an auditable record of approvals

For this reason, the `rateLimitAdmin` role is typically assigned to a multisig wallet rather than to an individual account.

## What the multisig submits

Regardless of the interface used, a multisig ultimately submits a transaction that calls:

- the token pool contract address
- the `setChainRateLimiterConfig` function
- the selected remote chain selector
- inbound and outbound configuration tuples

The multisig does not change how rate limits work on-chain; it only controls how the transaction is approved and submitted.

## Building the transaction

To build a rate limit update transaction using a multisig:

- identify the correct token pool contract address
- prepare the `setChainRateLimiterConfig` function call
- supply the remote chain selector
- enter the inbound and outbound configuration values as tuples

Configuration tuples must be entered as arrays containing:

- `isEnabled`
- `capacity`
- `rate`

All numeric values must be expressed in the token’s smallest unit.

## Tooling options

Common tooling options for executing multisig transactions include:

- Safe transaction builder
- custom scripts that submit transactions to the multisig
- internal operator tooling built on top of web3 libraries

The specific interface used does not affect the on-chain outcome.

## Verification before submission

Before submitting a multisig transaction:

- confirm the token pool contract address
- verify the remote chain selector
- recheck inbound and outbound directions
- validate capacity and rate values in base units

Because rate limit changes take effect immediately, careful review is essential.

## After execution

Once the multisig transaction is executed and confirmed on-chain:

- the updated rate limits apply immediately
- transfers follow the new configuration

Monitor behavior after execution to confirm the expected outcome.

## setChainRateLimiterConfig ABI

The following ABI is provided to support multisig and transaction builder workflows where the function interface must be supplied manually. This is a direct representation of the function used to update CCIP rate limits.
