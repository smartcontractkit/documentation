title: "Inspect Current Rate Limits"
---

Before updating any rate limit configuration, you should inspect the **current inbound and outbound settings** for the token pool and lane you are managing. This ensures you understand the existing capacity, refill rate, and enabled state before making changes.

## What you can inspect

Each token pool exposes read-only functions that return the current rate limiter state for a given remote chain. These values describe:

- whether the inbound or outbound rate limit is enabled
- the configured capacity
- the configured refill rate
- the current number of tokens available in the bucket
- the timestamp of the last refill

Together, these values determine whether transfers are currently allowed and how quickly capacity becomes available.

## Identify the token pool contract

To inspect rate limits, you first need the **token pool contract address** for the token you are managing.

You can find token pool addresses using the Token Manager or by searching for the token contract address in the token manager search interface.

## Select the remote chain

Rate limits are configured per remote chain. When querying a rate limiter, you must provide the **remote chain selector** that identifies the cross-chain lane you want to inspect.

Chain selectors are represented as `uint64` values. You can find the correct selector for each supported network in the CCIP directory.

## Query inbound and outbound limiter state

Most token pool contracts expose public getter functions similar to:

```solidity
function getCurrentInboundRateLimiterState(
  uint64 remoteChainSelector
) external view returns (TokenBucket memory);

function getCurrentOutboundRateLimiterState(
  uint64 remoteChainSelector
) external view returns (TokenBucket memory);

```

These functions take a remote chain selector as input and return the current **TokenBucket** state for that lane.

You can call these functions using:

- a block explorer’s “Read Contract” interface
- a web3-enabled script or client

## Interpreting the TokenBucket state

A typical rate limiter state includes the following fields:

```solidity
struct TokenBucket {
  uint128 tokens;
  uint32 lastUpdated;
  bool isEnabled;
  uint128 capacity;
  uint128 rate;
}
```

Where:

- tokens (uint128): the current number of tokens available in the bucket
- lastUpdated (uint32): the timestamp of the last refill
- isEnabled (bool): whether the rate limit is active
- capacity (uint128): the maximum bucket size
- rate (uint128): the refill rate in tokens per second
- All numeric values are expressed in the token’s **smallest unit**, not in whole tokens.

## Inbound vs outbound inspection

Inbound and outbound configurations should be inspected **independently**:

- outbound limits control transfers leaving the current chain
- inbound limits control transfers entering the current chain

Although these values are often similar, they may intentionally differ based on risk tolerance and traffic patterns.

## Before proceeding

After inspecting the current configuration:

- record the existing values
- confirm token decimals and unit conversions
- identify which direction and lane you intend to modify

Only proceed to updating rate limits once you fully understand the current state.
