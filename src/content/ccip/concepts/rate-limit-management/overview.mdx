title: "Rate Limit Management Overview"
---

CCIP rate limits are an **operator-level control** that apply to token pools used for cross-chain transfers. They are designed to limit the volume of tokens that can move across a specific CCIP lane over time, reducing the blast radius of unexpected behavior and helping manage operational risk.

This documentation is intended for **CCIP operators, token issuers, and administrators** who have been granted permission to manage rate limits on their token pool contracts. Most CCIP users do **not** need to interact with rate limits as part of a standard integration.

Rate limit changes are applied on-chain, take effect immediately, and directly affect user-facing transfer availability.

## What rate limits are

Rate limits in CCIP act as **capacity buckets** that refill over time. Each token pool maintains two independent limits for every connected chain:

- **Outbound rate limits**: how much of a token can be sent _from_ the current chain to a remote chain
- **Inbound rate limits**: how much of a token can be received _from_ a remote chain into the current chain

Each limit is defined by:

- whether it is enabled
- a maximum capacity
- a refill rate (tokens per second)

Together, these parameters control how much value can flow through a CCIP lane within a given time window.

## Why rate limits exist

Rate limits are a defensive mechanism. They help:

- prevent large, single transfers from draining liquidity unexpectedly
- limit exposure during misconfiguration, incidents, or active investigations
- give operators time to react if abnormal activity is detected

Inbound and outbound limits are intentionally separate so that operators can tune risk asymmetrically depending on the direction of flow.

## Who this applies to

You should only interact with CCIP rate limits if **all** of the following are true:

- You operate or administer a CCIP token pool
- Your wallet (typically a multisig) has been granted the `rateLimitAdmin` role
- You understand the decimal precision and units used by the token
- You are prepared to take responsibility for the operational impact of changes

If these conditions are not met, you should not attempt to modify rate limits.

## Responsibility and risk

Managing rate limits directly affects the availability of cross-chain transfers for a token. Incorrect configuration can:

- unintentionally halt bridging
- allow more volume than intended
- create congestion or stuck transfers

Changes are applied on-chain and take effect immediately. Always review parameters carefully, verify units, and use a multisig workflow where possible.

## What this section covers

The pages in this section walk through:

- how CCIP rate limits work
- required permissions and prerequisites
- inspecting current inbound and outbound configurations
- accounting for token decimals and units
- updating rate limits safely
- emergency actions such as locking down a lane
- common configuration scenarios

This content focuses on **operational control**, not on basic CCIP integration or application development.
