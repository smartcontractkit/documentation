title: "How Rate Limits Work"
---

This page explains how CCIP rate limits function at a conceptual level. It focuses on _what the system does_ and _how the parameters interact_, without covering how to make changes on-chain.

## Rate limits as capacity buckets

CCIP rate limits are implemented as **capacity buckets** that refill over time. Each bucket starts with a defined maximum capacity and refills continuously at a fixed rate.

Transfers draw down capacity from the relevant bucket. If insufficient capacity is available, the transfer is rejected until enough capacity has refilled.

This model limits how much value can move through a CCIP lane within a given time window, even if many transfers are attempted.

## Inbound and outbound rate limits

Each token pool maintains **two independent rate limits per connected chain**:

- **Outbound rate limit**: limits transfers _from_ the local chain _to_ a remote chain
- **Inbound rate limit**: limits transfers _from_ a remote chain _into_ the local chain

Inbound and outbound limits are configured separately and can differ in capacity and refill rate. This allows operators to tune risk asymmetrically depending on the direction of flow.

In practice, outbound limits are often configured to be slightly lower than inbound limits to provide buffer room and reduce the risk of in-flight congestion.

## Core rate limit parameters

Each inbound or outbound rate limit is defined by three parameters:

- **isEnabled**: whether the rate limit is active
- **capacity**: the maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred before the bucket is depleted
- **rate**: the speed at which capacity refills, measured in tokens per second

All values are expressed in the token’s **smallest unit**, not in whole tokens.

## Token bucket state

At any moment, a rate limiter tracks the current state of its bucket, including:

- the remaining number of tokens available
- the timestamp of the last refill
- whether the limiter is enabled
- the configured capacity and refill rate

This state determines whether a transfer can proceed and how quickly capacity becomes available again after use.

## Enabled vs disabled behavior

When a rate limit is **enabled**, transfers are constrained by the configured capacity and refill rate.

When a rate limit is **disabled**, transfers are not subject to any volume limits for that lane.

Disabling rate limits removes an important safety mechanism and should only be done intentionally and with a clear understanding of the associated risk.

## Scope and granularity

Rate limits are applied:

- per token pool
- per remote chain
- independently for inbound and outbound directions

This means changes to a rate limit affect only a specific token and lane, not all CCIP traffic.

## What this page does not cover

This page does not cover:

- required permissions to manage rate limits
- how to inspect current configurations
- how to update or disable rate limits
- emergency or incident response actions

Those topics are covered in the subsequent pages of this section.
