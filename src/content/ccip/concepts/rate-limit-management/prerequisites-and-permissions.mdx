Managing CCIP rate limits is a privileged, operator-level action. Before attempting to inspect or modify any rate limit configuration, you must meet the prerequisites described on this page.

## Required permissions

To manage rate limits, your wallet must be granted the **`rateLimitAdmin`** role on the relevant token pool contracts.

This role allows the wallet to update inbound and outbound rate limit configurations for specific cross-chain lanes. Without it, you can read on-chain data but cannot make changes.

In most cases, the `rateLimitAdmin` role is assigned to a **multisig wallet** rather than to an individual externally owned account.

## How admin access is granted

Admin access is not self-assigned.

To receive the `rateLimitAdmin` role:

- You provide the address of your designated wallet (typically a multisig)
- Chainlink Labs assigns that address as the rate limit administrator on the relevant token pool contracts

Once the on-chain transaction granting this role is confirmed, the wallet can update rate limit configurations.

## Scope of admin authority

The `rateLimitAdmin` role applies:

- per token pool
- across inbound and outbound directions
- per connected chain

This means:

- you can manage rate limits only for token pools where your wallet has been granted access
- changes affect only the specified token and lane
- core CCIP configuration outside of rate limits is not affected

## Operational expectations

Before making any changes, you should ensure that:

- you understand the token’s decimal precision and smallest unit
- you have reviewed the current inbound and outbound configurations
- you are prepared to validate values carefully before submitting transactions

Rate limit changes are applied on-chain and take effect immediately.

## Responsibility boundary

By managing rate limits, you take responsibility for the availability of cross-chain transfers for the affected token and lane.

Incorrect configuration can:

- unintentionally block transfers
- allow more volume than intended
- create operational or user-facing disruption

For this reason, rate limit management should follow a deliberate review process and use a multisig workflow where possible.

## What’s next

If you meet these prerequisites, the next step is to inspect the current inbound and outbound rate limit configuration before making any changes.
