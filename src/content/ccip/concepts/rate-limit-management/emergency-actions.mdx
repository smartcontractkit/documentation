title: "Emergency Actions (Incident Response Only)"
---

This page describes emergency actions that can be taken to **contain or halt cross-chain transfers on a specific CCIP lane** using rate limit configuration.

These actions are intended for **incident response, maintenance, or risk containment** scenarios. They should not be used for routine configuration.

## When to use emergency actions

You may need to take emergency action if:

- abnormal or unexpected transfer activity is detected
- a misconfiguration or incident is under investigation
- maintenance requires temporarily stopping transfers on a lane

Emergency actions are scoped to a **specific token pool and lane**. They do not pause CCIP globally.

## Locking down a lane with minimal values

To effectively stop bridging activity on a lane, you can configure rate limits with **very small capacity and refill values**.

Because rate limits cannot be set to zero while enabled, the practical approach is to set:

- **capacity** to the smallest transferable unit (for example, `1`)
- **rate** to `1`

This configuration allows only a negligible transfer before the bucket is depleted, causing subsequent transfers to fail.

## Example configuration

Conceptually, a lane can be locked down by calling `setChainRateLimiterConfig` with the following values:

- outboundConfig: `[true, "1", "1"]`
- inboundConfig: `[true, "1", "1"]`

Both inbound and outbound limits should be set to ensure transfers are blocked in both directions.

## Important considerations

When locking down a lane:

- transfers may still succeed for a minimal amount before capacity is exhausted
- behavior depends on the token’s smallest unit
- the change takes effect immediately after the transaction is confirmed

This approach is intended to **contain activity**, not to permanently disable rate limits.

## Restoring normal operation

To resume normal transfers, update the inbound and outbound rate limit configuration with appropriate capacity and refill values.

Always revalidate token units and existing configuration before restoring service.

## What this page does not cover

This page does not cover:

- routine rate limit tuning
- worked examples for different token decimals
- fully removing rate limits

Those topics are covered in the [common scenarios](/ccip/concepts/rate-limit-management/common-scenarios) section.
