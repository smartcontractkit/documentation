When configuring CCIP rate limits, **all values are specified in the token’s smallest unit**, not in whole tokens. Understanding token decimals is critical to setting correct capacity and refill rates.

Incorrect unit handling can result in rate limits that are orders of magnitude larger or smaller than intended.

## Smallest unit vs human-readable amounts

Every ERC-20 token defines a number of decimal places that determine its smallest unit:

- An 18-decimal token (for example, LINK or ETH) uses `10^18` base units per token
- A 6-decimal token (for example, USDC or USDT) uses `10^6` base units per token

Rate limit parameters such as **capacity** and **rate** must always be provided in these base units.

## Converting values for on-chain configuration

To convert a human-readable token amount into the value used on-chain, apply the following formula:

```
On-chain value = human-readable amount × (10 ^ token decimals)
```

This conversion applies to:

- capacity values
- refill rate values

## Example: 18-decimal token

Token:

- Decimals: 18
- Desired capacity: 100 tokens

Calculation:

```
100 × 10^18 = 100000000000000000000
```

The capacity value passed to the token pool contract must be `100000000000000000000`.

## Example: 6-decimal token

Token:

- Decimals: 6
- Desired capacity: 500 tokens

Calculation:

```
500 × 10^6 = 500000000
```

The capacity value passed to the token pool contract must be `500000000`.

## Common failure modes

The most common causes of misconfiguration include:

- assuming values are specified in whole tokens
- applying the wrong decimal precision
- copying example values without recalculating for the target token

Any of these mistakes can:

- unintentionally block transfers
- allow far more volume than expected
- create operational risk that is difficult to detect immediately

## Before updating rate limits

Before submitting any transaction that updates rate limits:

- verify the token’s decimal precision
- recompute capacity and rate values from first principles
- double-check values in base units

Once values are submitted on-chain, they take effect immediately.

## What’s next

After validating units and conversions, you can proceed to [updating inbound and outbound rate limits](ccip/concepts/rate-limit-management/update-rate-limits) for the selected token pool and lane.
