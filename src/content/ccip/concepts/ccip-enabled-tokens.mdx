  Familiarize yourself with CCIP [Concepts](/ccip/concepts) and [Architecture](/ccip/architecture) before enabling
  tokens for CCIP.
</Aside>

This conceptual guide will walk you through enabling your tokens in Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This involves deploying your tokens and token pools, registering administrative roles, and configuring token pools to ensure your tokens can be transferred in CCIP.

## Enabling a Token for CCIP

### Step 1: Determine if the Token is Already Deployed

The process begins by checking whether the token has already been deployed on the blockchains you intend to support with CCIP.

- **If the token still needs to be deployed**, deploy the token.  
  **Note**: Ensure that the administrator's address, which will manage the token in CCIP, can be derived from the token contract (see next step). This can be achieved if your contract exposes one of the following functions:

  - `owner()`: Returns the token contract owner's address.
  - `getCCIPAdmin()`: Expose this function if the token administrator will be different from the contract owner.

- **If the token has already been deployed**, you can move on to the next step.

### Step 2: Administrator Address Derivation

Now, we need to verify if the administrator address can be derived directly from the token contract:

- **If the administrator address can be derived**, the administrator can self-register.

- **If the administrator address cannot be derived**, **contact Chainlink Labs**. The CCIP contract owner will manually register the administrator to proceed.

### Step 3: Administrator Registration

In this step, the administrator must formally register themselves as the token administrator. This step is crucial for managing token pools and other administrative operations within CCIP. There are two possible methods for registering the admin, depending on how the token contract is configured:

1. **Using the `owner` method**:  
   If the token contract uses the `owner()` function to expose the administratorâ€™s address, the admin can register by calling the [`registerAdminViaOwner`](/ccip/api-reference/registry-module-owner-custom#registeradminviaowner) function on the [`RegistryModuleOwnerCustom`](/ccip/api-reference/registry-module-owner-custom) contract.

1. **Using the `getCCIPAdmin` method**:  
   If the token contract exposes a different function for the administrator address, such as `getCCIPAdmin()`, the administrator can register using the [`registerAdminViaGetCCIPAdmin`](/ccip/api-reference/registry-module-owner-custom#registeradminviagetccipadmin) function on the same [`RegistryModuleOwnerCustom`](/ccip/api-reference/registry-module-owner-custom) contract.

### Step 4: Accept Admin Request

After registering, the administrator must **accept the admin role** to finalize the process. This step confirms their administrative control over the token.

- To complete this, the administrator calls the [`acceptAdminRole`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry#acceptadminrole) function on the [`TokenAdminRegistry`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry) contract.

### Step 5: Deploy the Token Pool

Once administrative access is confirmed, the administrator can deploy a **token pool**. Token pools are responsible for handling cross-chain operations, such as minting and burning in the case of a [Burn and Mint Token Pool](/ccip/api-reference/burn-mint-token-pool), or managing liquidity in the case of a [Lock and Release Token Pool](/ccip/api-reference/lock-release-token-pool) during cross-chain transfers in CCIP.

### Step 6: Register the Token Pool

After deploying the token pool, the administrator needs to register the pool for the specific token. This step links the token to its corresponding pool, allowing the pool to manage cross-chain transfers.

- The administrator must call the [`setPool`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry#setpool) function on the [`TokenAdminRegistry`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry) contract. This registration ensures that the token pool is recognized within CCIP and can properly handle token liquidity during cross-chain transfers.

### Step 7: Configure the Token Pool

Once the token pool is registered, the administrator needs to configure it to handle cross-chain transfers efficiently. This involves setting parameters like token pool rate limits and enabling specific destination chains for the token.

- The administrator must call the [`applyChainUpdates`](/ccip/api-reference/token-pool#applychainupdates) function on the token pool contract. This function allows you to configure the pool by specifying cross-chain transfer settings, such as the allowed chains and token pool rate limits.
