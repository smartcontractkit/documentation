This section explains the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard, a Chainlink CCIP feature enabling secure and reliable cross-chain token transfers. Learn about the architecture, token requirements, token pool types (Lock and Release, Burn and Mint), registration processes, administrative roles, and upgrade mechanisms needed to make your tokens compatible with CCIP across different blockchain families.

For a high-level summary of the CCT standard and its benefits, see the [Overview](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/overview) page.
