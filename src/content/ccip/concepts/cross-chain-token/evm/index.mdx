This section provides detailed guidance for integrating tokens with Chainlink CCIP on EVM-compatible blockchains.

- **[Architecture](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/evm/architecture)**: Understand the specific architecture for CCTs on EVM chains.
- **[Tokens](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/evm/tokens)**: Learn about the requirements and compatibility for your tokens.
- **[Token Pools](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/evm/token-pools)**: Explore the different types of token pools and how to use them.
- **[Registration and Administration](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/evm/registration-administration)**: Details on registering your token with CCIP and managing administrative roles.
- **[Upgradability](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/evm/upgradability)**: Information on upgrading token pool contracts.
