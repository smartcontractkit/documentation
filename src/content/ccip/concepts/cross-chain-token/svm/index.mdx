This section provides detailed guidance for integrating tokens with Chainlink CCIP on SVM-based blockchains like Solana.

- **[Architecture](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/architecture)**: Understand the specific architecture for CCTs on SVM chains.
- **[Tokens](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/tokens)**: Learn about the requirements and compatibility for your SPL tokens.
- **[Token Pools](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools)**: Explore the different types of token pool programs and how to use them.
- **[Registration and Administration](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/registration-administration)**: Details on registering your token with CCIP and managing administrative roles on SVM.
- **[Upgradability](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/upgradability)**: Information on upgrading token pool programs.
