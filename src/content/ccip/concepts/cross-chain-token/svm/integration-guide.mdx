This integration guide helps you determine the optimal path for integrating your SPL token with Chainlink CCIP on SVM-based blockchains like Solana. Follow the decision tree below to understand your specific requirements, deployment options, and when you can use self-service versus when you need Chainlink assistance.

<Aside type="note" title="Need Assistance?">
  If your integration requires Chainlink assistance (manual registration or pool initialization), submit a [registration
  request](https://chain.link/ccip-contact?v=Tokens:%20Token%20admin%20registration) with details about your token and
  requirements.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

Before starting integration, ensure you meet these requirements:

- **Token Compatibility**: Your token must meet [compatibility requirements](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/tokens#compatibility)
- **Decimal Planning**: Plan [decimal configuration](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/tokens#decimal-planning) across all target blockchains
- **Pool Type Selection**: Choose the appropriate token pool type for your use case:
  - **[BurnMint Pools](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#burnmint-token-pool)**: Burn tokens on source, mint on destination. Requires transferring mint authority to pool. Best for tokens designed to have variable supply across chains.

  - **[LockRelease Pools](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#lockrelease-token-pool)**: Lock tokens on source, release on destination. No mint authority transfer required. Requires liquidity management. Best for retaining mint authority control or capped-supply tokens.

  For detailed comparisons and technical requirements, see [Token Handling Mechanisms](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#token-handling-mechanisms).

## Integration Overview

CCIP Cross-Chain Token (CCT) integration involves two key phases:

1. **Token Registration**: Establishing a CCIP token administrator role
1. **Token Pool Deployment**: Setting up the pool program that handles cross-chain operations

Your path through these phases depends on your **mint authority control** and chosen **[deployment approach](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#deployment-approaches)**.

## Mint Authority Assessment

The first critical decision point is understanding your mint authority control, as this determines your available options throughout the integration process.

**Why mint authority control matters for token registration:** The Router's [`owner_propose_administrator`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#owner_propose_administrator) instruction can only be called by the actual mint authority holder. The Router verifies onchain that the signer account matches the token's `mint_authority` field. If you cannot sign this instruction as the mint authority, the Router cannot verify your authorization onchain, requiring manual governance assistance.

**You have direct control when:**

- You hold the mint authority private key directly
- You control a governance multisig that holds the mint authority (non-SPL token multisig)
- You can execute mint authority operations through your governance process

**You do NOT have direct control when:**

- Mint authority is set to `None` (supply capped)
- Mint authority is held by an SPL token multisig
- Mint authority is controlled by another party you cannot coordinate with
- You have lost access to the mint authority private key

<Aside type="caution" title="SPL Token Multisig Limitation">
  **Critical:** While SPL token multisigs can mint tokens, they can only execute SPL token program instructions. They
  cannot call other program instructions required for CCIP registration
  ([`owner_propose_administrator`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#owner_propose_administrator)) or pool
  initialization ([`initialize`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/burn-mint-token-pool#initialize)). If your mint
  authority is an SPL token multisig, you will need Chainlink assistance for both registration and pool initialization.
</Aside>

## Integration Paths

Based on your mint authority control, follow the appropriate integration path:

### Path A: Full Self-Service (Mint Authority Controlled)

**When to use:** You have direct control over the mint authority

**Registration Process:**

- **Self-service registration**: Use [`owner_propose_administrator`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#owner_propose_administrator) and [`accept_admin_role_token_admin_registry`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#accept_admin_role_token_admin_registry) instructions (propose + accept)
- **Immediate control**: Complete registration without external assistance
- **Administrator flexibility**: Choose any address as the CCIP token administrator

**Pool Deployment Options:**

1. **[Self-Serve Mode](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#approach-1-self-serve-mode-recommended) (Recommended)**
   - Use Chainlink-deployed standard pool programs
   - Initialize your pool using [`initialize`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/burn-mint-token-pool#initialize) instruction
   - Automatic governance-controlled upgrades
   - Lowest operational overhead

2. **[Self-Deployed Standard Pools](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#approach-2-self-deployed-standard-pools)**
   - Deploy standard pool programs yourself
   - Control upgrade authority and timing
   - Initialize your own pools

3. **[Custom Token Pools](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#approach-3-custom-token-pools)**
   - Build custom pool logic for specialized requirements
   - Full control over implementation and upgrades

### Path B: Assisted Registration + Self-Serve Pools (Mint Authority Not Controlled)

**When to use:** You want to use self-serve mode pools, but you cannot call [`owner_propose_administrator`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#owner_propose_administrator) as the mint authority

**Registration Process:**

- **Manual registration required**: Submit [registration request](https://chain.link/ccip-contact?v=Tokens:%20Token%20admin%20registration)
- **CCIP governance assistance**: Router upgrade authority will propose the administrator using [`ccip_admin_propose_administrator`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#ccip_admin_propose_administrator)
- **Choose administrator**: You specify who should be the CCIP token administrator

**Pool Deployment:**

- **Assisted pool initialization**: Submit [registration request](https://chain.link/ccip-contact?v=Tokens:%20Token%20admin%20registration) to have the pool program upgrade authority initialize your pool
- **Self-serve mode benefits**: Once initialized, you become the pool owner with full configuration control
- **Governance-controlled upgrades**: Benefit from automatic security updates and features

### Path C: Full Manual Process (Custom or Self-Deployed)

**When to use:** You cannot call [`owner_propose_administrator`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#owner_propose_administrator) as the mint authority and want self-deployed or custom pools

**Registration Process:**

- Same manual registration process as Path B

**Pool Deployment:**

- **Deploy your own programs**: Full control over pool program deployment
- **Control upgrade authority**: Manage your own upgrade process
- **Initialize independently**: Use your upgrade authority to initialize pools

<Aside type="note" title="Why Manual Registration is Required">
  Paths B and C require manual registration because the Router's
  [`owner_propose_administrator`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#owner_propose_administrator) instruction can
  only be called by the actual mint authority holder. The Router verifies onchain that the signer account matches the
  token's `mint_authority` field. If you cannot sign this instruction as the mint authority (because you don't control
  it, it's set to `None`, or it's an SPL token multisig), the Router cannot verify your authorization onchain, requiring
  manual governance assistance.
</Aside>

## Implementation Steps

Once you've determined your path, follow these implementation steps:

### Step 1: Complete Registration

- **Self-service path**: Follow [self-service registration](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/registration-administration#self-service-registration-flow)
- **Assisted path**: Submit [registration request](https://chain.link/ccip-contact?v=Tokens:%20Token%20admin%20registration)

### Step 2: Deploy and Initialize Token Pool

Choose your deployment approach:

- **Self-serve mode**: Initialize pool from existing Chainlink-deployed programs
  - **If you can sign as mint authority**: Use the [`initialize`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/burn-mint-token-pool#initialize) instruction directly
  - **If you cannot sign as mint authority** (mint authority is `None`, held by SPL token multisig, or controlled by another party): Submit [registration request](https://chain.link/ccip-contact?v=Tokens:%20Token%20admin%20registration) for assisted initialization

- **Self-deployed**: Deploy standard pool programs yourself, then initialize pool from your deployed program

- **Custom**: Implement and deploy custom pool following [technical requirements](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#custom-token-pools), then initialize pool from your deployed program

### Step 3: Create Associated Token Account

- Create the [Associated Token Account (ATA)](https://www.solana-program.com/docs/associated-token-account) for the Pool Signer PDA
- **Required**: Pool operations cannot begin without this ATA
- The ATA will hold tokens for LockRelease pools or serve as the burn account for BurnMint pools

### Step 4: Transfer Mint Authority (BurnMint Pools Only)

Choose one of two approaches:

- **Direct Transfer**: Transfer `mint_authority` directly to the Pool Signer PDA (simple, pool-only minting)
- **Multisig Setup (Recommended)**: Create an M-of-N [SPL token multisig](https://spl.solana.com/token#multisig-usage) with Pool Signer PDA appearing at least M times as a signer (flexible, multiple authorized minters)

See [Mint Authority Management](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/token-pools#mint-authority-management) for detailed configuration options.

### Step 5: Create Address Lookup Table (ALT)

- Create an ALT containing all required accounts for your pool operations
- Must include required accounts in specific order as detailed in the [`set_pool` API reference](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#address-lookup-table-requirements)
- See the complete [ALT requirements table](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#address-lookup-table-requirements) for exact account order and derivations

### Step 6: Link Pool to Token Registry

- Call [`set_pool`](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v0.1.1/router#set_pool) instruction on the Router
- Links your pool's ALT to your token in the TokenAdminRegistry
- Enables CCIP to route cross-chain transfers to your pool

### Step 7: Configure Pool Settings

- Complete [remote chain configuration](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/registration-administration#remote-chain-configuration)
- Set up [rate limits and security settings](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/registration-administration#rate-limits-and-security)
- **For LockRelease pools**: Configure [liquidity management](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/svm/registration-administration#liquidity-management-lockrelease-pools-only)
