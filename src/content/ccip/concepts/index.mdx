This section explores the foundational concepts of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Understanding these concepts will help you effectively build and deploy secure cross-chain applications.

- **[Architecture](/ccip/concepts/architecture)**: Understand the core components and structure of CCIP, including onchain and offchain systems.
- **[Cross-Chain Token Standard](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token)**: Learn about the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard that enables secure token transfers across different blockchains.
- **[Best Practices](/ccip/concepts/best-practices)**: Discover recommended guidelines for using CCIP effectively and securely on both EVM and SVM blockchains.
- **[Manual Execution](/ccip/concepts/manual-execution)**: Learn why some CCIP messages might require manual execution and how to handle these situations.
