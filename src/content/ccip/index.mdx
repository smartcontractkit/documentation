Given the [inherent risks of cross-chain interoperability](/resources/bridge-risks), CCIP features [defense-in-depth security](https://blog.chain.link/five-levels-cross-chain-security/#level_5__defense-in-depth) and is powered by Chainlink's industry-standard oracle networks which have a proven track record of securing tens of billions of dollars and enabling over $14 trillion in onchain transaction value.

CCIP's robust security framework is built upon several core components:

- **Proven Decentralized Architecture**: CCIP leverages the same highly reliable infrastructure as Chainlink Data Feeds, which has enabled trillions in transaction value across hundreds of DeFi applications. Cross-chain transactions are validated by multiple decentralized oracle networks (DONs).
- **Rate Limiting**: To mitigate risk, CCIP includes a rate limiting feature. This allows owners to establish and configure policies for Cross-Chain Tokens, which are then enforced on both the source and destination chains.
- **Timelocked Upgrades**: All on-chain, security-critical configuration changes and core infrastructure upgrades must pass through a Role-based Access Control Timelock contract. This process provides a review period during which CCIP node operators can veto the upgrade, or, in time-sensitive situations, explicitly approve it.
- **High-Quality, Sybil-Resistant Node Operators**: The system is secured by the same globally distributed, security-reviewed, public node operators that secure other Chainlink services, validate leading blockchain networks, and operate traditional Web2 infrastructure. Each independent CCIP node is run by a distinct organization with extensive DevOps expertise and rigorous private key management security practices.
