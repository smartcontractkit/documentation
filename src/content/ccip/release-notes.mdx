## Chainlink CCIP is GA - 2024-04-24

Chainlink CCIP is now Generally Available (GA) on mainnet and testnet.

To support your development and implementation needs, we encourage you to reach out to our team of experts for guidance and support. For expert advice, visit the [Chainlink CCIP Contact form](https://chain.link/ccip-contact).

Additionally, the [Chainlink CCIP local
simulator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local) is available to enhance your development workflow with CCIP. This tool allows you to simulate Chainlink CCIP functionality locally within your Hardhat and Foundry projects. The simulator is designed so you can test your contracts locally and transition smoothly to test networks without any modifications.

## Support for WETH transfers and gas limit mainnet increase - 2024-04-11

### WETH and support of _Lock and Unlock_ mechanism

Chainlink's CCIP now supports WETH (Wrapped Ether) transfers through the _Lock and Unlock_ token mechanism. This feature allows CCIP to securely lock tokens on the source blockchain and subsequently release an equivalent amount of tokens on the destination blockchain, facilitating seamless cross-chain transfers of WETH.

The introduction of this mechanism enables WETH transfers across several key lanes:

- Ethereum Mainnet to/from Arbitrum Mainnet.
- Ethereum Mainnet to/from Optimism Mainnet.
- Arbitrum Mainnet to/from Optimism Mainnet.

For a specific lane configuration, go to the [Mainnet Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/mainnet) page. For more detailed information on the _Lock and Unlock_ mechanism and its applications, read the [Token Pools](/ccip/architecture#token-pools) section.

### Gas limit increase on mainnet

The maximum [gasLimit](/ccip/api-reference/client#evmextraargsv1) that you can set for CCIP messages on mainnet has been increased to 3,000,000 gas units. The change has been documented in the [Service Limits](/ccip/service-limits) page.

## v1.0.0 deprecated on mainnet - 2024-04-01

CCIP v1.0.0 is no longer supported on **mainnet**. You must use the new router addresses listed in the [CCIP v1.2.0 configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/mainnet).

## Wemix and Kroma - 2024-03-11

Chainlink CCIP is publicly available on Wemix and Kroma for both mainnet and testnet.

## v1.0.0 deprecated on testnet - 2024-02-07

CCIP v1.0.0 is no longer supported on **testnet**. You must use the new router addresses listed in the [CCIP v1.2.0
configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/testnet).

## v1.2.0 release on mainnet - 2024-01-15

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation Notice for CCIP v1.0.0 on Mainnet">
  CCIP v1.0.0 has been deprecated on mainnet. You must use the new router addresses listed in this page **before March
  31st, 2024**. Please note that there is no change to the router interface. The CCIP v1.0.0 mainnet routers will
  continue to function in parallel **until March 31st, 2024**, but we highly recommend switching to the v1.2.0 routers
  as soon as possible. If you currently use CCIP v1.0.0, use the [@chainlink/contracts-ccip npm package version
  0.7.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/0.7.6). To migrate to v1.2.0, use [version 1.2.1 of
  the npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/1.2.1) or later. Please refer to the
  [release notes](/ccip/release-notes) for a comprehensive overview of the enhancements and new features in v1.2.0.
</Aside>

- There is no change to the router interface, but you must use the new router addresses listed in the [CCIP v1.2.0
  configuration page](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/mainnet).
- Added support for USDC transfers. USDC transfers are currently supported on the following lanes:

  - From Ethereum Mainnet to Avalanche Mainnet.
  - From Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum Mainnet.
  - From Ethereum Mainnet to Base Mainnet.
  - From Ethereum Mainnet to Optimism Mainnet.
  - From Optimism Mainnet to Base Mainnet.
  - From Optimism Mainnet to Ethereum Mainnet.
  - From Avalanche Mainnet to Ethereum Mainnet.
  - From Base Mainnet to Arbitrum Mainnet.
  - From Base Mainnet to Optimism Mainnet.
  - From Base Mainnet to Ethereum Mainnet.

  Refer to the [Supported Networks](/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/mainnet) to get a specific lane's token addresses and rate limits.

- We've simplified the message sequencing process in our CCIP message handling by removing the `strict` sequencing flag from the [extraArgs](/ccip/api-reference/client#evmextraargsv1) field in [CCIP messages](/ccip/api-reference/client#evm2anymessage).

- The gas limit and maximum message data length for CCIP messages have been adjusted on mainnets. These changes are detailed in the [Service Limits](/ccip/service-limits) documentation.

- To interact with CCIP v1.2.0 , use the [@chainlink/contract-ccip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip) npm package.
