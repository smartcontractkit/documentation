Chainlink CCIP enables secure cross-chain communication between Aptos and EVM blockchains. These tutorials will help you implement cross-chain functionality in both directions.

## Getting Started

Before diving into specific implementations, ensure you understand the fundamentals:

- [Prerequisites for Aptos to EVM Tutorials](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/prerequisites) - Set up your development environment for Aptos -> EVM CCIP development.
- [Prerequisites for EVM to Aptos Tutorials](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/prerequisites) - Set up your development environment for EVM -> Aptos CCIP development.

## Using Aptos as a Source Chain

Send messages and tokens from Aptos to EVM chains:

- [Aptos to EVM Guide](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source) - Comprehensive guide for building all types of CCIP messages from Aptos to EVM chains.
- [Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/token-transfers) - Transfer tokens from Aptos to EVM chains without executing code on the destination.

## Using Aptos as a Destination Chain

Send messages and tokens from EVM chains to Aptos:

- [EVM to Aptos Guide](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination) - Comprehensive guide for building all types of CCIP messages from EVM chains to Aptos.
- [Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/token-transfers) - Transfer tokens from EVM chains to Aptos wallets.
  {/* - [Arbitrary Messaging](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/arbitrary-messaging) - Send data from EVM chains to execute programs on Aptos */}

## Architecture Reference

Key Differences from EVM:

- **Account Model:** Aptos uses an account-based model where code (modules) and data (resources) are stored directly within accounts.
- **Resource Model:** The Move language on Aptos uses a resource model that provides strong ownership and access control, ensuring resources cannot be duplicated or accidentally destroyed.
- **Explicit Access:** Modules define functions that can explicitly access and modify the resources stored within an account.
- **Fungible Assets:** Tokens are typically handled via the Fungible Asset standard, where assets are stored as resources within an owner's account.

Message Types:

- **Token Transfers:** Send tokens across chains without program execution.
- **Arbitrary Messaging:** Send data to trigger program execution on the destination chain.
- **Programmable Token Transfers:** Send both tokens and data in a single message to trigger program execution with token transfers.

<Aside type="note">
  These tutorials use the Aptos Testnet and Ethereum Sepolia testnet for demonstration purposes. When deploying to
  production, make sure to thoroughly test your implementation and follow all security best practices.
