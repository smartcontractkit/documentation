This page lists tools developed to assist with building and interacting with Chainlink CCIP.

## CCIP Tools TS (`ccip-tools-ts`)

[GitHub Repository: smartcontractkit/ccip-tools-ts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-tools-ts)

This is a TypeScript command-line interface (CLI) and library designed for interacting with deployed CCIP contracts on supported blockchains.

**Key Features:**

- **Query CCIP Data:** View details about specific CCIP messages using transaction hashes (`show`).
- **Manual Execution:** Manually trigger the execution of CCIP messages on the destination chain (`manualExec`).
- **Send Messages:** Construct and send new CCIP messages, including data and token transfers (`send`).
- **Estimate Gas:** Calculate the estimated gas required for a CCIP message execution (`estimateGas`).
- **Lane Information:** Inspect the configuration of specific CCIP lanes (`lane`).
- **Token Discovery:** Check which tokens are supported for transfer on a given lane (`getSupportedTokens`).
- **Debugging:** Parse raw EVM transaction data related to CCIP contracts (`parseBytes`).

This tool is useful for debugging interactions, automating tasks, verifying configurations, and manually interacting with the CCIP protocol. It requires RPC endpoint configuration and wallet access (private key or Ledger) for certain commands.

<Aside type="note">The ccip-tools-ts tool is intended for convenience and illustration.</Aside>
