<Aside type="note" title="Early Access">
  Chainlink CCIP is in the “Early Access” stage of development, which means that Chainlink CCIP currently has
  functionality which is under development and may be changed in later versions. There is no guarantee any of the
  contemplated features of Chainlink CCIP or the Chainlink Network will be implemented as specified. Chainlink CCIP is a
  messaging protocol. Chainlink does not hold or transfer any assets. Please review the [Chainlink Terms of
  Service](https://chain.link/terms) which provides important information and disclosures. By using Chainlink CCIP, you
  expressly acknowledge and agree to accept these terms.
