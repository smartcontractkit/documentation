## BurnMintTokenPoolAbstract

[`BurnMintTokenPoolAbstract`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/tree/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.0/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/pools/BurnMintTokenPoolAbstract.sol) is an abstract contract that extends the [`TokenPool`](/ccip/api-reference/token-pool) contract. It defines the common logic for burning tokens in the pool. This contract contains validation mechanisms and logic for burning tokens in the context of a cross-chain token transfer. The main goal of this abstract contract is to allow different pools to inherit from it and customize the specific burn logic.

## BurnMintTokenPool and BurnFromMintTokenPool

The [`BurnMintTokenPool`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/blob/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.0/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/pools/BurnMintTokenPool.sol) and [`BurnFromMintTokenPool`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/blob/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.0/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/pools/BurnFromMintTokenPool.sol) contracts are concrete implementations that inherit from [`BurnMintTokenPoolAbstract`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/tree/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.0/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/pools/BurnMintTokenPoolAbstract.sol). Both are designed to mint and burn a 3rd-party token, but they differ in how the token burning is implemented:

- `BurnMintTokenPool` uses the `burn(amount)` function for burning tokens.
- `BurnFromMintTokenPool` uses the `burnFrom(address, amount)` function, where the contract burns tokens from its own balance.

### \_burn

```solidity
function _burn(uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

Contains the specific burn call for a pool.

_Overriding this method allows us to create pools with different burn signatures without duplicating the underlying logic._

### lockOrBurn

```solidity
function lockOrBurn(struct Pool.LockOrBurnInV1 lockOrBurnIn) external virtual returns (struct Pool.LockOrBurnOutV1)
```

Burn the token in the pool.

_The \_validateLockOrBurn check is an essential security check._

### releaseOrMint

```solidity
function releaseOrMint(struct Pool.ReleaseOrMintInV1 releaseOrMintIn) external virtual returns (struct Pool.ReleaseOrMintOutV1)
```

Mint tokens from the pool to the recipient.

_The \_validateReleaseOrMint check is an essential security check._

## BurnMintTokenPool

[`BurnMintTokenPool`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/tree/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.0/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/pools/BurnMintTokenPool.sol) is a concrete implementation that inherits from [`BurnMintTokenPoolAbstract`](#burnminttokenpoolabstract). It is designed to mint and burn a 3rd-party token, using the `burn(amount)` function for burning tokens. Pool whitelisting mode is set during the contract's deployment and cannot be modified later. The pool either accepts any address as the `originalSender` or restricts to a whitelisted set of senders.

This contract variant is particularly suited for use cases where the tokenâ€™s minter and burner roles need to be adjustable.

### typeAndVersion

```solidity
string typeAndVersion
```

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(contract IBurnMintERC20 token, address[] allowlist, address rmnProxy, address router) public
```

### \_burn

```solidity
function _burn(uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

Contains the specific burn call for a pool.
