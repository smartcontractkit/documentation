When invoking the `ccipSend` [function](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.5.0/i-router-client#ccipsend) or when a message is executed via `ccipReceive`, various events are emitted by CCIP contracts. Below is a compiled list of events you can expect during CCIP operations.

## `ccipSend`

These events are emitted when sending a cross-chain message using the `ccipSend` [function](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.5.0/i-router-client#ccipsend).

### OnRamp

<CCIPEvent type="onramp-send" version="v1_5_0" />

## `ccipReceive`

These events are emitted when a cross-chain message is executed on the destination chain.

### OffRamp
