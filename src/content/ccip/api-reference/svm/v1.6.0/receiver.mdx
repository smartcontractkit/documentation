## Receiver

Below is a complete API reference for the `ccip_receive` instruction that must be implemented by any Solana program wishing to receive CCIP messages.

### `ccip_receive`

This instruction is the entry point for receiving a cross-chain message on an SVM-based blockchain from any source blockchain.

```rust
pub fn ccip_receive(
    ctx: Context<CcipReceive>,
    message: Any2SVMMessage
) -> Result<()>;
```

#### Parameters

| Name      | Type             | Description                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message` | `Any2SVMMessage` | The cross-chain message being delivered. See [Message Structure](/ccip/api-reference/svm/v1.6.0/messages#any2svmmessage) for details. |

#### Context (Accounts)

These are the required accounts that must be passed to implement a secure CCIP Receiver. The first three accounts form the critical security validation chain and must be implemented exactly as shown.

| Field                          | Type                                   | Writable? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authority`                    | <nobr>`Signer<'info>`</nobr>           | No        | The Offramp CPI signer PDA. This must be the first account.<br/>**Derivation**: `[EXTERNAL_EXECUTION_CONFIG_SEED, receiver_program_id]` under the `offramp_program`.                                            |
| <nobr>`offramp_program`</nobr> | <nobr>`UncheckedAccount<'info>`</nobr> | No        | The Offramp program ID. This exists only to derive the allowed offramp PDA and must be the second account.                                                                                                      |
| `allowed_offramp`              | <nobr>`UncheckedAccount<'info>`</nobr> | No        | PDA owned by the Router program that verifies this Offramp is allowed.<br/>**Derivation**: `[ALLOWED_OFFRAMP, source_chain_selector, offramp_program_key]` under the Router program. Must be the third account. |
| _Additional accounts_          | _Various_                              | _Varies_  | The receiver program can define additional accounts as needed for its specific logic (state accounts, token accounts, etc.). These are application-specific.                                                    |

#### Implementation Requirements

1. **Instruction Name and Discriminator**:

   - If using Anchor, the instruction name must be exactly `ccip_receive`.
   - If not using Anchor, the instruction discriminator must be `[0x0b, 0xf4, 0x09, 0xf9, 0x2c, 0x53, 0x2f, 0xf5]`.

1. **Security Pattern**:

   - The first three accounts in the `CcipReceive` context must follow the exact pattern shown above.
   - Your program must store the Router address (typically in a state account) to verify the `allowed_offramp` PDA.

1. **Account Validation**:

   - The `authority` must be validated as a PDA derived from the offramp program.
   - The `allowed_offramp` must be validated as a PDA owned by the router program with the correct seeds.

1. **State Management**:
   - The receiver program should maintain state that includes at minimum the router address.
   - Optionally track processed message IDs to prevent replay attacks.

## Example

Below is a minimal example of a secure `CcipReceive` context implementation:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts, Debug)]
#[instruction(message: Any2SVMMessage)]
pub struct CcipReceive<'info> {
    // Offramp CPI signer PDA must be first.
    #[account(
        seeds = [EXTERNAL_EXECUTION_CONFIG_SEED, crate::ID.as_ref()],
        bump,
        seeds::program = offramp_program.key(),
    )]
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,

    /// CHECK offramp program: exists only to derive the allowed offramp PDA
    pub offramp_program: UncheckedAccount<'info>,

    /// CHECK PDA of the router program verifying the signer is an allowed offramp.
    #[account(
        owner = state.router @ CcipReceiverError::InvalidCaller,
        seeds = [
            ALLOWED_OFFRAMP,
            message.source_chain_selector.to_le_bytes().as_ref(),
            offramp_program.key().as_ref()
        ],
        bump,
        seeds::program = state.router,
    )]
    pub allowed_offramp: UncheckedAccount<'info>,

    // Program-specific state account - must contain router address
    #[account(
        seeds = [STATE],
        bump,
    )]
    pub state: Account<'info, BaseState>,

    // Additional program-specific accounts...
}
```

And a minimal implementation of the `ccip_receive` instruction:

```rust
pub fn ccip_receive(ctx: Context<CcipReceive>, message: Any2SVMMessage) -> Result<()> {
    // Process message data
    if !message.data.is_empty() {
        // Process arbitrary data payload
    }

    // Process token transfers
    if !message.token_amounts.is_empty() {
        // Handle received tokens
    }

    // Emit event for tracking
    emit!(MessageReceived {
        message_id: message.message_id
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

## Token Handling

When implementing a CCIP Receiver that needs to handle token transfers, you must create a PDA that will serve as the token administrator. This PDA will have the authority to sign token transfer instructions.

### Token Admin PDA

Create a dedicated PDA to manage tokens within your program:

```rust
// During program initialization
#[account(
    init,
    seeds = [TOKEN_ADMIN_SEED],
    bump,
    payer = authority,
    space = ANCHOR_DISCRIMINATOR,
)]
/// CHECK: CPI signer for tokens
pub token_admin: UncheckedAccount<'info>,
```

### Using remaining_accounts for Token Transfers

When handling token transfers, the number of accounts passed depends on the specific token being handled. The `ccip_receive` handler should use `remaining_accounts` to access these token accounts.

Below is an example of a typical token transfer implementation:

```rust
// Example of token-related accounts in remaining_accounts
// For each token transfer:
// 1. token_mint: Account<Mint>
// 2. source_token_account: Account<TokenAccount> (owned by program with token_admin authority)
// 3. token_admin: UncheckedAccount (the PDA with authority)
// 4. recipient_token_account: Account<TokenAccount>
// 5. token_program: Program<Token>

// Example token transfer logic
pub fn handle_token_transfer(ctx: Context<CcipReceive>, message: Any2SVMMessage) -> Result<()> {
    // Check if we have sufficient remaining accounts for token handling
    if ctx.remaining_accounts.len() < 5 {
        return Err(ErrorCode::InvalidRemainingAccounts.into());
    }

    // Extract account references from the remaining_accounts
    let token_mint_info = &ctx.remaining_accounts[0];
    let source_token_account = &ctx.remaining_accounts[1];
    let token_admin_info = &ctx.remaining_accounts[2];
    let recipient_account_info = &ctx.remaining_accounts[3];
    let token_program_info = &ctx.remaining_accounts[4];

    // Verify the token_admin is the expected PDA
    let (expected_token_admin, admin_bump) =
        Pubkey::find_program_address(&[TOKEN_ADMIN_SEED], &crate::ID);
    if token_admin_info.key() != expected_token_admin {
        return Err(ErrorCode::InvalidTokenAdmin.into());
    }

    // Create and execute the token transfer instruction
    let seeds = &[TOKEN_ADMIN_SEED, &[admin_bump]];
    let signer_seeds = &[&seeds[..]];

    // Transfer tokens using CPI with the PDA as signer
    // ... token transfer code ...

    Ok(())
}
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Security Critical">

    The security of your CCIP Receiver depends on correctly implementing the account validation pattern shown above. Always validate that:

    1. The `authority` is derived from the Offramp program
    1. The `allowed_offramp` is derived from and owned by the Router program
    1. The Router address used for validation is securely stored in your program's state
