## Ownable2Step

A minimal contract that implements 2-step ownership transfer and nothing more. It's made to be minimal to reduce the impact of the bytecode size on any contract that inherits from it.

[Git Source](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/blob/0df0625eea603ba8572d5382d72979a7f2b12bfb/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/access/Ownable2Step.sol)

<Aside type="note">
This contract implements a secure two-step ownership transfer process:

1. Current owner initiates transfer using `transferOwnership`
2. New owner must accept using `acceptOwnership`
3. Transfer only completes after both steps

This prevents accidental transfers to incorrect or inaccessible addresses.

</Aside>

## Events

### OwnershipTransferRequested

```solidity
event OwnershipTransferRequested(address indexed from, address indexed to);
```

<Aside>Emitted when the current owner initiates an ownership transfer.</Aside>

**Parameters**

| Name   | Type      | Description                           |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `from` | `address` | Current owner initiating the transfer |
| `to`   | `address` | Proposed new owner                    |

### OwnershipTransferred

```solidity
event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed from, address indexed to);
```

<Aside>Emitted when an ownership transfer is completed.</Aside>

**Parameters**

| Name   | Type      | Description    |
| ------ | --------- | -------------- |
| `from` | `address` | Previous owner |
| `to`   | `address` | New owner      |

## Errors

### CannotTransferToSelf

```solidity
error CannotTransferToSelf();
```

<Aside>Thrown when attempting to transfer ownership to the current owner.</Aside>

### MustBeProposedOwner

```solidity
error MustBeProposedOwner();
```

<Aside>Thrown when someone other than the pending owner tries to accept ownership.</Aside>

### OnlyCallableByOwner

```solidity
error OnlyCallableByOwner();
```

<Aside>Thrown when a restricted function is called by someone other than the owner.</Aside>

### OwnerCannotBeZero

```solidity
error OwnerCannotBeZero();
```

<Aside>Thrown when attempting to set the owner to address(0).</Aside>

## State Variables

### s_owner

The owner is the current owner of the contract.

```solidity
address private s_owner;
```

<Aside>
  The owner is the second storage variable so any implementing contract could pack other state with it instead of the
  much less used s_pendingOwner.
</Aside>

### s_pendingOwner

The pending owner is the address to which ownership may be transferred.

```solidity
address private s_pendingOwner;
```

## Functions

### acceptOwnership

Allows an ownership transfer to be completed by the recipient.

```solidity
function acceptOwnership() external override;
```

<Aside>

Reverts with `MustBeProposedOwner` if caller is not the pending owner.

When successful:

- Updates owner to the caller
- Clears pending owner
- Emits OwnershipTransferred event

</Aside>

### constructor

Initializes the contract with an owner and optionally a pending owner.

```solidity
constructor(address newOwner, address pendingOwner);
```

<Aside>

- Reverts with `OwnerCannotBeZero` if newOwner is address(0)
- Sets newOwner as the initial owner
- If pendingOwner is not address(0), initiates ownership transfer to pendingOwner

</Aside>

**Parameters**

| Name           | Type      | Description                                        |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `newOwner`     | `address` | The initial owner of the contract                  |
| `pendingOwner` | `address` | Optional address to initiate ownership transfer to |

### onlyOwner

Modifier that restricts function access to the contract owner.

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner();
```

<Aside>Reverts with `OnlyCallableByOwner` if caller is not the current owner.</Aside>

### owner

Returns the current owner's address.

```solidity
function owner() public view override returns (address);
```

**Returns**

| Type      | Description                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `address` | The address of the current owner |

### transferOwnership

Allows an owner to begin transferring ownership to a new address.

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address to) public override onlyOwner;
```

<Aside>

The new owner must call `acceptOwnership` to complete the transfer. No permissions are changed until acceptance.

Reverts with:

- `OnlyCallableByOwner` if caller is not the current owner
- `CannotTransferToSelf` if attempting to transfer to current owner

</Aside>

**Parameters**

| Name | Type      | Description                                        |
| ---- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `to` | `address` | The address to which ownership will be transferred |

### \_validateOwnership

Internal function to validate access control.

```solidity
function _validateOwnership() internal view;
```

<Aside>Reverts with `OnlyCallableByOwner` if caller is not the current owner. Used by the onlyOwner modifier.</Aside>
