## Ownable2StepMsgSender

A contract that facilitates two-step ownership transfer, providing enhanced security for ownership management. This contract extends `Ownable2Step` and automatically sets the deploying address (`msg.sender`) as the initial owner with no pending owner.

**Inherits:**

- [`Ownable2Step`](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/ownable-2-step) - Provides secure two-step ownership transfer functionality

<Aside type="note">
The two-step ownership transfer process enhances security by:
1. Requiring the current owner to initiate the transfer (step 1)
2. Requiring the new owner to accept ownership (step 2)

This prevents accidental transfers to incorrect or inaccessible addresses.

## Functions

### constructor

Initializes the contract with the deploying address as the owner and no pending owner.

```solidity
constructor() Ownable2Step(msg.sender, address(0));
```

<Aside>

The constructor:

- Sets `msg.sender` as the initial owner
- Sets `address(0)` as the initial pending owner (indicating no pending transfer)
- Inherits from Ownable2Step with these initial values
