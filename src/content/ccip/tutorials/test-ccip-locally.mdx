[Chainlink Local](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local) provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries to test your smart contracts with CCIP locally. By using Chainlink Local, you can quickly set up a local testing environment, simulate Chainlink services, and debug your contracts before deploying them to actual testnets.

## Why Use Chainlink Local?

Testing your smart contracts locally can save you a significant amount of time and effort. With Chainlink Local, you can:

- **Quickly identify and fix issues**: Debug your contracts in a controlled environment before deploying them to testnets.
- **Save time and resources**: Reduce the need for repeated deployments to testnets, speeding up the development process.
