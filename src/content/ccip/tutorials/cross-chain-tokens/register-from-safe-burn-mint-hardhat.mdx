title: "Enable your tokens in CCIP (Burn & Mint): Register from Safe multisig using Hardhat"
---

import { Aside, ClickToZoom } from "@components"
import CcipCommon from "@features/ccip/CcipCommon.astro"

This tutorial will guide you through enabling your tokens in CCIP using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and Safe Multisig [smart accounts](https://docs.safe.global/home/glossary#smart-account). You will learn how to deploy tokens and set up _Burn & Mint_ token pools using a 2-of-3 multi-signature Safe. After that, you will register the tokens in CCIP and configure them using multisig transactions without needing manual intervention. Finally, you will test the **Burn & Mint** token handling mechanism, where tokens are burned on the source blockchain, and an equivalent amount is minted on the destination blockchain.

## Introduction to Smart Accounts and Safe Multisig

### Introduction

A [**smart account**](https://docs.safe.global/home/glossary#smart-account) (also known as a smart contract account) leverages the programmability of smart contracts to extend their functionality and improve their security compared to externally owned accounts (EOAs). Smart accounts are controlled by one or multiple EOAs or other smart accounts, and all transactions must be initiated by one of these controllers.

Some common features of smart accounts include:

- **Multi-signature schemes**: Require multiple approvals for a transaction to be executed, enhancing security.
- **Transaction batching**: Combine multiple actions into a single transaction, reducing costs and improving efficiency.
- **Account recovery**: Allow for recovery mechanisms in case of lost access.
- **Gasless transactions**: Enable transaction fees to be paid by a third party or relayer.

**Safe** is one of the most trusted implementations of a smart account, offering a robust multi-signature mechanism. In this tutorial, we will use a Safe Multisig account, specifically a 2-of-3 multi-signature setup, where **two** out of **three** owners must approve a transaction to execute it. This setup ensures enhanced security and decentralized control over the assets.

The [**Protocol Kit**](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/protocol-kit) from Safe allows developers to interact with Safe, smart accounts through a TypeScript interface. This kit can be used to create new Safe accounts, update configurations, propose transactions, and execute them, making it an ideal choice for blockchain projects.

<Aside type="note" title="Safe Transaction Service API">
  In this tutorial, we will use **BASE Sepolia** and **Ethereum Sepolia** testnets. This is because Safe relies on the
  [**Safe Transaction Service API**](https://docs.safe.global/core-api/transaction-service-overview). The Safe
  Transaction Service offers a REST API to track transactions sent via the Safe Smart Account. It also provides
  endpoints to send transactions, collect signatures off-chain, and inform the owners about pending transactions to be
  broadcasted on-chain. The **Safe SDK** provides the **API Kit**, a TypeScript client for the Safe Transaction Service
  API, which is currently only supported on specific testnets such as BASE Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia. For more
  information, see the [Safe Transaction Service supported
  networks](https://docs.safe.global/core-api/transaction-service-supported-networks).

### How Safe Multisig Works

Before we proceed, let's take a moment to understand how the multisig transaction process works with a Safe smart account.

In this tutorial, we'll use a **2-of-3 multi-signature** setup as an example, where at least two out of the three Smart Account Owners must approve each transaction. Depending on your project's needs, this multisig process is valid for any scheme (e.g., 3-of-5, 4-of-7).
In Safe smart accounts, the **Smart Account Owners** are responsible for approving actions. Transactions are signed off-chain by the required number of owners, which improves efficiency and reduces gas costs. Once the necessary threshold is met, the signed transactions are submitted to the blockchain for execution. The Safe smart account (a smart contract) verifies the signatures and enforces the required number of approvals before executing the transaction.
This process enhances security, particularly for sensitive tasks such as registering a token administrator or configuring a token pool. Multi-signature ensures that no single owner can act alone.

The steps for enabling your tokens in CCIP follow the same flow as the [previous tutorials](/ccip/tutorials/cross-chain-tokens/register-from-eoa-burn-mint-hardhat) that used externally owned accounts (EOA). The key difference here is that for sensitive actions like token administrator registration or token pool configuration, we assume your project uses a Safe multisig. Therefore, multiple signatures are required off-chain; in some cases, a batch of transactions will be submitted to save on gas costs.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the multisig transaction flow in a Safe smart account, from off-chain signature collection to on-chain execution:

<ClickToZoom src="/images/ccip/cct/tutorials/safe-smart-account.svg" alt="How Safe Multisig works" />

In this diagram, the process is as follows:

1. **Signer 1** initiates the batch of transactions (one or multiple transactions) and signs off-chain.
1. **Signer 1** shares the batch with **Signer 2**, who signs it off-chain.
1. Once the required number of signatures is collected (in this case, **two**), the batch is submitted for execution.
1. The **Smart Account** verifies the signatures and checks that the signature threshold has been met.
1. The **Smart Account** then executes each transaction in the batch, interacting with the Target Smart Contract(s).
1. If any transaction fails, the entire batch is reverted. If all transactions succeed, they are confirmed on-chain.

By following this process, we maintain the security of multisig transactions while improving efficiency through the off-chain signature collection and gas savings from transaction batching.

### Steps covered in this tutorial

We will cover the following key steps:

1. **Creating a Safe Account**: You will create a 2-of-3 multi-signature Safe that will serve as the owner of the token and token pool contracts. This Safe will also manage administrative tasks, such as configuring token pools and registering as the token admin in the token admin registry.

1. **Deploying Tokens**: You will deploy your [`BurnMintERC677`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/tree/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/token/ERC677/BurnMintERC677.sol) tokens on the Ethereum Sepolia and BASE Sepolia testnets and transfer ownership to the Safe account.

1. **Deploying Token Pools**: Once your tokens are deployed, you will deploy [`BurnMintTokenPool`](/ccip/api-reference/burn-mint-token-pool) token pools on Ethereum Sepolia and BASE Sepolia. The Safe account will own each token pool.

1. **Claiming and Accepting the Admin Role**: This is a two-step process that will be managed using the Safe multi-signature account. It involves creating and signing multiple meta-transactions off-chain before executing them on-chain to register Safe as the token admin and accept the admin role for managing the tokens and token pools.

   1. You will call the [`RegistryModuleOwnerCustom`](/ccip/api-reference/registry-module-owner-custom) contract's [`registerAdminViaOwner`](/ccip/api-reference/registry-module-owner-custom#registeradminviaowner) function to register the Safe as the token admin. This role is required to enable your token in CCIP.

   1. Once claimed, you will call the [`TokenAdminRegistry`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry) contract's [`acceptAdminRole`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry#acceptadminrole) function to complete the registration process.

   Meta-transactions are used here to batch these two actions, allowing both steps to be executed efficiently. The meta-transactions are created off-chain and signed by each of the two required Safe owners. This off-chain signing process reduces gas costs and enhances security, as the transactions are only broadcasted to the blockchain once all required signatures are collected.

1. **Linking Tokens to Pools**: You will use the Safe account to call the [`TokenAdminRegistry`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry) contract's [`setPool`](/ccip/api-reference/token-admin-registry#setpool) function to associate each token with its respective token pool.

1. **Configuring Token Pools**: You will configure each token pool by setting cross-chain transfer parameters, such as token pool rate limits and enabled destination chains, using multisig transactions through the Safe account.

1. **Granting Mint and Burn Roles**: You will grant the mint and burn roles to the token pools on each linked token using the Safe account. These roles are required for the token pools to mint and burn tokens during cross-chain transfers.

1. **Minting Tokens**: You will mint tokens on Ethereum Sepolia. These tokens will later be used to test cross-chain transfers to BASE Sepolia.

1. **Transferring Tokens**: Finally, you will transfer tokens from Ethereum Sepolia to BASE Sepolia using CCIP. You can pay CCIP fees using either LINK tokens or native gas tokens.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have successfully deployed, registered, configured, and enabled your tokens and token pools for use in CCIP. All are managed securely through a multi-signature Safe account.

## Before You Begin

1.  Make sure you have Node.js v18 or above installed. If not, **install Node.js v18**:  
    [Download Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it installed. Optionally, you can use the [nvm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) to switch between Node.js versions:

    ```bash
    nvm use 18
    ```

    Verify that the correct version of Node.js is installed:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    Example output:

    ```bash
    $ node -v
    v18.7.0
    ```

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git
    cd smart-contract-examples/ccip/cct/hardhat
    ```

1.  **Install dependencies for the project:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Compile the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run compile
    ```

1.  **Encrypt your environment variables for higher security:**  
    The project uses [@chainlink/env-enc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc) to encrypt your environment variables at rest. Follow the steps below to configure your environment securely:

    1. Set an encryption password for your environment variables:

       ```bash
       npx env-enc set-pw
       ```

    1. Set up a `.env.enc` file with the necessary variables for Ethereum Sepolia and BASE Sepolia testnets. Use the following command to add the variables:

       ```bash
       npx env-enc set
       ```

       Variables to configure:

       - `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: A URL for the _Ethereum Sepolia_ testnet. You can get a personal endpoint from services like [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).
       - `BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: A URL for the _BASE Sepolia_ testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).
       - `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key for the first signer of the Safe multisig account. If you use MetaMask, you can follow this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/) to export your private key. **Note:** This key is used to create and sign the transaction of the first signer.
       - `PRIVATE_KEY_2`: The private key for the second signer of the Safe multisig account. If you use MetaMask, you can follow this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/) to export your private key. **Note:** This key is used to create and sign the transaction of the second signer.
       - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: An API key from Etherscan to verify your contracts. You can obtain one from [Etherscan](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics).
       - `BASESCAN_API_KEY`: An API key from Basescan to verify your contracts on BASE. See [this guide](https://docs.basescan.org/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) to get one from Basescan.

1.  **Fund the EOA linked to the first private key with LINK and native gas tokens**:  
    Make sure your EOA has enough LINK and native gas tokens on Ethereum Sepolia and BASE Sepolia to cover transaction fees. You can use the [Chainlink faucets](https://faucets.chain.link/) to get testnet tokens. **Important clarifications**:
    - Off-chain signatures are collected for this tutorial. The first EOA is responsible for sending the transactions to the Safe smart account, meaning only the first EOA requires enough native gas tokens for these transactions.
    - When transferring the deployed tokens from Ethereum Sepolia to BASE Sepolia, the first EOA will be used to pay the CCIP fees in LINK. Therefore, it is crucial that the first EOA has sufficient LINK tokens to cover these fees. If a different EOA were to initiate the CCIP transfer, that EOA would need to hold enough LINK tokens.

## Tutorial

<Aside type="note" title="Explore the Code">
  All Hardhat tasks used in this tutorial are located in the `tasks/safe-multisig` directory of the repository. Each
  task is thoroughly commented and directly linked to a key step in the tutorial, making the code self-explanatory. Read
  the code and comments to gain a deeper understanding of the process or explore the implementation details.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Funding and Signature Clarifications">
  In this tutorial, the first EOA is responsible for sending transactions involving the Safe smart account. Therefore,
  **only the first EOA must have sufficient native gas tokens to cover transaction fees** for all operations. It is also
  important to note that during multi-signature operations, **signatures will be collected from the second EOA
  off-chain** to fulfill the required number of signatures, but the first EOA will handle the on-chain transaction
  submissions.

### Deploy Safe Smart Accounts

In this step, you will deploy a Safe smart account on both Ethereum Sepolia and BASE Sepolia using the `deploySafe` task. The Safe smart account will serve as the multi-signature account, requiring approvals from multiple owners to authorize transactions. You can customize the number of owners and the required threshold for signatures.

Below is an explanation of the parameters used during deployment:

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                          | Default | Required |

<Aside type="note" title="Record Safe contract addresses">
  Make sure to record the addresses of the deployed Safe smart accounts. You will need these addresses to interact with
  the Safe smart accounts in the following steps.
</Aside>

### Deploy Tokens

In this step, you will deploy a token on both Ethereum Sepolia and BASE Sepolia using the `deployTokenWithSafe` task, then transfer ownership of the token to the Safe multisig account. This ensures that the Safe smart account controls the token, requiring multiple signatures to authorize any future administrative actions.

Below is an explanation of the parameters used during deployment:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                        | Default | Required |

| `decimals`         | The number of decimal places the token supports (e.g., `18` means 1 token is represented as 1e18 smallest units).                                  | `18`    | No       |
| `initialsupply`    | The initial supply of tokens to be created upon deployment. Set to `0` to deploy the token with no initial supply.                                 | `0`     | No       |
| `verifycontract`   | Whether to verify the contract on Etherscan or a similar blockchain explorer.                                                                      | `false` | No       |

### Accept Ownership of Tokens

After deploying the token and transferring ownership to the Safe smart account, the Safe smart account must formally accept ownership of the contract. This is done by collecting signatures from two owners off-chain and then submitting the transaction for on-chain execution.

The `acceptOwnershipFromSafe` task handles this process, ensuring that the Safe smart account securely accepts ownership of the deployed token contract.

Below is an explanation of the parameters used during this task:

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                        | Required |

| `safeaddress`     | The address of the Safe smart account that will accept ownership of the contract.                                                                  | Yes      |
| `network`         | The blockchain network where the transaction will be executed. Examples include `sepolia` for Ethereum Sepolia and `baseSepolia` for BASE Sepolia. | Yes      |

### Accept Ownership of Token Pools

Just like with the tokens, after deploying the token pools and transferring ownership to the Safe smart account, the Safe smart account must formally accept ownership of the token pools. This ensures that all administrative actions for the token pools will require multisig approval, ensuring a secure and decentralized management process.

The process of accepting ownership is identical to the one described in the [Accept Ownership of Tokens](#accept-ownership-of-tokens) step above. You will use the same function to accept ownership of the token pools, with two Safe owners signing the transaction off-chain, and one of them submitting it for on-chain execution.

Refer to the table in the [Accept Ownership of Tokens](#accept-ownership-of-tokens) section for the required parameters.

1. **Accept ownership of the token pool on Ethereum Sepolia** (Replace `0xContractAddress` and `0xSafeAddress` with the token pool contract address and Safe smart account address, respectively):

   ```bash
   npx hardhat acceptOwnershipFromSafe --contractaddress 0xContractAddress --safeaddress 0xSafeAddress --network sepolia
   ```

   Example output:

   ```bash

### Claim and Accept Token Admin Role using Safe

In this step, you will use the `claimAndAcceptAdminRoleFromSafe` task to claim and accept the admin role for the deployed tokens in a single Ethereum transaction. By leveraging Safe's batching feature, we can efficiently combine the two operations—claiming the admin role and accepting the admin role—into one on-chain interaction. This reduces gas costs and improves efficiency.

The process will use the Safe smart account to sign the transaction off-chain, collect the required signatures from multiple owners, and then execute it on-chain.

Below is an explanation of the parameters used during this task:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                   | Default | Required |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `withccipadmin` | A flag indicating whether the token contract has a CCIP admin. If `false`, the admin role is claimed using the `owner()` function.            | `false` | No       |
| `tokenaddress`  | The address of the token for which the admin role will be claimed and accepted.                                                               | N/A     | Yes      |
| `safeaddress`   | The address of the Safe smart account that will execute the transactions and become the token admin.                                          | N/A     | Yes      |
| `network`       | The blockchain on which the transaction will be executed. Examples include `sepolia` for Ethereum Sepolia and `baseSepolia` for BASE Sepolia. | N/A     | Yes      |

### Grant Mint and Burn Roles using Safe

In this step, you will use the `grantMintBurnRoleFromSafe` task to grant mint and burn roles to both the token pool and the Safe smart account on Ethereum Sepolia and BASE Sepolia. The Safe smart account will handle the transaction to securely assign these roles, ensuring that multiple owners sign off on the operation. Granting mint and burn roles is essential to allow the token pool and the Safe account to manage token issuance and burning, and to prepare for future cross-chain transfers.

This process will grant:

- Mint and burn roles to the token pool for handling cross-chain operations.
- Mint and burn roles to the Safe smart account for minting tokens to EOAs for testing purposes.

Below is an explanation of the parameters used during this task:

   ```

### Configure Token Pools using Safe

In this step, you will use the `applyChainUpdatesFromSafe` task to configure a token pool for cross-chain interactions. By leveraging the Safe smart account, you can securely update the configuration of the token pool to support remote chains, including setting rate limits and linking it to remote pools and tokens.

The task handles complex cross-chain setups, allowing you to define rate limits for both inbound and outbound token transfers. The transaction is signed by the Safe owners off-chain and then executed on-chain, ensuring secure multi-signature control over the pool configuration.

### Mint Tokens to an EOA using Safe

In this step, you will use the `mintTokensFromSafe` task to mint tokens to an EOA on Ethereum Sepolia. This process uses a Safe smart account to securely manage the minting process, ensuring that the transaction is signed by multiple owners off-chain before being executed on-chain. These tokens will be used for transfers through CCIP from Ethereum Sepolia to BASE Sepolia.

Below is an explanation of the parameters used during this task:

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                    | Required |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `tokenaddress`      | The address of the token contract from which the tokens will be minted.                                        | Yes      |
| `amount`            | The amount of tokens to mint for each recipient address.                                                       | Yes      |
| `receiveraddresses` | A comma-separated list of recipient addresses (EOAs) that will receive the minted tokens.                      | Yes      |
| `safeaddress`       | The address of the Safe smart account that will execute the transaction to mint tokens.                        | Yes      |
| `network`           | The blockchain on which the minting transaction will be executed. For example, `sepolia` for Ethereum Sepolia. | Yes      |

1. **Mint tokens to an EOA on Ethereum Sepolia** (Replace `0xTokenAddress`, `0xSafeAddress`, and `0xReceiverAddress` with the token address, Safe smart account address, and recipient address, respectively):

   ```bash
   npx hardhat mintTokensFromSafe --tokenaddress 0xTokenAddress --amount 100000000000000000000 --receiveraddresses 0xReceiverAddress --safeaddress 0xSafeAddress --network sepolia
   ```

   Example output:

   ```bash

   ```

### Transfer Tokens

In this step, you will use the `transferTokens` task to transfer tokens from Ethereum Sepolia to BASE Sepolia using CCIP. You have two options for paying CCIP fees: using LINK tokens or native gas tokens.

You will interact with the `IRouterClient` contract, specifically calling the `ccipSend()` function to initiate the token transfer.

Below is an explanation of the parameters used during the token transfer process:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                  | Default | Required |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `tokenaddress`     | The address of the token being transferred.                                                                  | N/A     | Yes      |
| `amount`           | The amount of tokens to transfer.                                                                            | N/A     | Yes      |
| `destinationchain` | The blockchain to which the tokens will be transferred. Examples include `baseSepolia`, and `sepolia`.       | N/A     | Yes      |
| `receiveraddress`  | The address of the receiver on the destination blockchain.                                                   | N/A     | Yes      |
| `fee`              | The type of fee used for the transfer, either `LINK` or `native`.                                            | `LINK`  | No       |
| `network`          | The blockchain on which the token transfer will be initiated. Examples include `baseSepolia`, and `sepolia`. | N/A     | Yes      |

#### Pay fees in LINK

Call the CCIP Router to transfer tokens from Ethereum Sepolia to BASE Sepolia, paying the CCIP fees in LINK tokens. Replace the token address, amount, receiver address, and blockchain with the appropriate values:

```bash
npx hardhat transferTokens --tokenaddress 0xTokenAddress --amount 2000000000000000000 --destinationchain baseSepolia --receiveraddress 0xReceiverAddress --fee LINK --network sepolia
```

Example output:

```bash
$ npx hardhat transferTokens --tokenaddress 0xa852f8E6FCEfCFf4F74828811055c7eCDFf247af --amount 2000000000000000000 --destinationchain baseSepolia --receiveraddress 0x9d087fc03ae39b088326b67fa3c788236645b717 --fee LINK --network sepolia
