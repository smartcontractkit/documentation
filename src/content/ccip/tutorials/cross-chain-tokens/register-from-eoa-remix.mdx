This tutorial will guide you through enabling your tokens in CCIP using only your web browser and [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). You'll learn how to deploy tokens and set up token pools without needing to install any development tools.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

1. **Web Browser Setup**:

   - Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
   - Configure MetaMask with your blockchains. You can do this in two ways:

     **Option 1: Using Chainlist**

     1. Visit [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)
     1. Search for your desired blockchains (check "Include Testnets" for testnets)
     1. Click "Add to MetaMask" for each blockchain
     1. Confirm the addition in MetaMask popup

     **Option 2: Manual Configuration**

     - Follow MetaMask's [official guide](https://support.metamask.io/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc/) to add blockchains manually

1. Get native tokens for gas fees:
   - For testnets, you can get these from blockchain-specific faucets
   - For mainnets, you'll need to acquire the native tokens through an exchange

<Aside type="note" title="Blockchain Requirements">
  Make sure your chosen blockchains are CCIP-supported. You can find the list of supported blockchains in the [CCIP
  Directory](/ccip/directory).
</Aside>

## Tutorial

### Select Your Blockchains

<TutorialBlockchainSelector
  client:load
  onSourceChange={(chain) => {
    // This will be used to dynamically update tutorial values
    console.log("Source chain:", chain)
  }}
  onDestinationChange={(chain) => {
    // This will be used to dynamically update tutorial values
    console.log("Destination chain:", chain)
  }}
/>

### Import Required Contracts

1. Open the pre-configured token contract in Remix:

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/cct/TokenDependencies.sol" showButtonOnly={true} optimize={true} runs={1000} />

1. Wait a few seconds for Remix to automatically compile all contracts. You'll see a green checkmark next to "Solidity Compiler" in the left sidebar when compilation is complete.

1. Once compilation is complete, click on "Deploy & Run Transactions" in the left sidebar to proceed with deployment.

### Source Blockchain Setup

#### Deploy Token

1. Ensure MetaMask is connected to [Selected Source Blockchain]

1. In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab:
   - Set Environment to "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
   - Select **BurnMintERC677** contract
   - Configure deployment parameters:
     - `name`: Your token's full name (e.g., "My Cross Chain Token")
     - `symbol`: A short identifier for your token (e.g., "MCCT")
     - `decimals`: Number of decimal places for token amounts
     - `maxSupply`: Maximum total supply in wei (use 0 for unlimited supply)
   - Click "Deploy" and confirm in MetaMask
   - Save your token address here: [Input field for token address]

<Aside type="note" title="About the Parameters">
  - The `name` and `symbol` help identify your token in wallets and applications - Using 18 `decimals` is standard for
  most ERC20 tokens (1 token = 1000000000000000000 wei) - Setting `maxSupply` to 0 allows unlimited minting. For a
  limited supply, specify the amount in wei (e.g., for max 1000 tokens with 18 decimals: 1000000000000000000000)
</Aside>

Example values for the parameters:

```
name: "My Cross Chain Token"
symbol: "MCCT"
decimals: 18
maxSupply: 0
```

#### Claim and Accept Admin Role

1. Ensure MetaMask is still connected to [Selected Source Blockchain]

2. Register as admin:
   - Use "At Address" with the RegistryModuleOwnerCustom contract: [Source Chain Registry Address]
   - Call `registerAdminViaOwner` with your token address

#### Deploy Token Pool

1. Ensure MetaMask is still connected to [Selected Source Blockchain]

2. Deploy the pool:
   - Select appropriate pool type
   - Configure deployment parameters:
     - tokenAddress: [Value from saved token address]
     - localTokenDecimals: 18
     - routerAddress: [Auto-populated based on selected blockchain]
     - rmnProxyAddress: [Auto-populated based on selected blockchain]
   - Click "Deploy" and confirm in MetaMask
   - Save your pool address

#### Set Token Pool in Registry

1. Ensure MetaMask is still connected to [Selected Source Blockchain]

2. Configure the registry:
   - Use TokenAdminRegistry at: [Source Chain Admin Registry]
   - Call `setPool` with your token address and pool address

### Destination Blockchain Setup

#### Deploy Token

1. Ensure MetaMask is connected to [Selected Destination Blockchain]
