This tutorial will guide you through enabling your tokens in CCIP using only your web browser and [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). You'll learn how to deploy tokens and set up token pools without needing to install any development tools.

## How to Follow This Tutorial

This is an interactive, step-by-step tutorial with progress tracking:

- **Progress Tracking**: A navigation panel on the right shows your progress through the tutorial
- **Checkboxes**: Each step has a checkbox - mark it when you complete that step
- **Contract Addresses**: Some steps are automatically marked complete when you provide the deployed contract addresses
- **Sequential Flow**: Steps should be completed in order, as each builds upon the previous ones

<Aside type="tip" title="Stay Organized">
  Keep track of your deployed contract addresses - you'll need them throughout the tutorial. Each step will prompt you
  when an address is required.
