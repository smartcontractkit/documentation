This tutorial will guide you through enabling your tokens in CCIP using only your web browser and [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). You'll learn how to deploy tokens and set up token pools without needing to install any development tools.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

1. **Web Browser Setup**:

   - Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
   - Configure MetaMask with your blockchains. You can do this in two ways:

     **Option 1: Using Chainlist**

     1. Visit [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)
     1. Search for your desired blockchains (check "Include Testnets" for testnets)
     1. Click "Add to MetaMask" for each blockchain
     1. Confirm the addition in MetaMask popup

     **Option 2: Manual Configuration**

     - Follow MetaMask's [official guide](https://support.metamask.io/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc/) to add blockchains manually

1. Get native tokens for gas fees:
   - For testnets, you can get these from blockchain-specific faucets
   - For mainnets, you'll need to acquire the native tokens through an exchange

<Aside type="note" title="Blockchain Requirements">
  Make sure your chosen blockchains are CCIP-supported. You can find the list of supported blockchains in the [CCIP
  Directory](/ccip/directory).

## Tutorial

### Select Your Blockchains

<TutorialBlockchainSelector
  client:load
  onSourceChange={(chain) => {
    // This will be used to dynamically update tutorial values
    console.log("Source chain:", chain)
  }}
  onDestinationChange={(chain) => {
    // This will be used to dynamically update tutorial values
    console.log("Destination chain:", chain)
  }}
/>

### Import Required Contracts

1. Open the pre-configured token contract in Remix:

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/cct/TokenDependencies.sol" showButtonButton={true} optimize={true} runs={1000} />

2. The contract includes all necessary dependencies and is ready to be compiled. You don't need to manually import anything else.

### Deploy Token

1. **Compile the token contract**:

   - Switch to the "Solidity Compiler" tab
   - Select compiler version 0.8.19
   - Click "Compile BurnMintERC677.sol"

2. **Deploy on Source Blockchain**:
   - Switch to "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
   - Set Environment to "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
   - Select "MyToken" contract
   - Configure deployment parameters:
     - name: [Input field for token name]
     - symbol: [Input field for token symbol]
     - decimals: 18
     - maxSupply: 0 (for unlimited supply)
   - Ensure MetaMask is connected to [Selected Source Blockchain]
   - Click "Deploy" and confirm in MetaMask
   - Save your token address here: [Input field for token address]

### Deploy Token Pool

[Configuration values will be based on selected blockchains]

1. **Deploy on Source Blockchain**:
   - Switch to "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
   - Select appropriate pool type
   - Configure deployment parameters:
     - tokenAddress: [Value from saved token address]
     - localTokenDecimals: 18
     - routerAddress: [Auto-populated based on selected blockchain]
     - rmnProxyAddress: [Auto-populated based on selected blockchain]

### Claim Admin Role

In this step, you'll register your EOA as the administrator for the deployed tokens. You'll interact with the `RegistryModuleOwnerCustom` contract through Remix.

1. **Create interface file**:
   Create `IRegistryModuleOwnerCustom.sol`:

   ````solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   interface IRegistryModuleOwnerCustom {
       function registerAdminViaOwner(address token) external;
   }   ```

   ````

2. **Claim admin on Source Blockchain**:

   - Switch to Source Blockchain in MetaMask
   - Use "At Address" in Remix with the RegistryModuleOwnerCustom contract address: `0x95F29FEE11c5C55d26cCcf1DB6772DE953B37B82`
   - Call `registerAdminViaOwner` with your Source Blockchain token address

3. **Claim admin on Destination Blockchain**:
   - Switch to Destination Blockchain
   - Use address: `0x736D0bBb318c1B27Ff686cd19804094E66250e17`
   - Repeat the process with your Destination Blockchain token address

### Accept Admin Role

Create `ITokenAdminRegistry.sol`:
