title: "Using the Token Manager"
---

The Token Manager allows token developers to deploy, configure, and manage their own token pools by using the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard in a simplified web interface.

The process involves deploying tokens and token pools, registering administrative roles, and configuring token pools to enable secure token transfers using CCIP. The Token Manager guides you through two workflows:

- **Deploy a new token from scratch**: This is the more beginner-friendly workflow that guides you through the entire process step-by-step, starting by creating a token from scratch.
- **Enable an existing token to go cross-chain**: This is a more advanced workflow for token developers who have already deployed their token and want to add cross-chain configuations.

If you prefer to manage your deployments and configuations programmatically, refer to the [Cross-Chain Tokens](/ccip/tutorials/cross-chain-tokens) tutorials available in both Hardhat and Foundry.

## Limitations

Currently, the following advanced features are not yet supported in Token Manager:

- For existing tokens, token pool replacements and upgrades are not yet supported in Token Manager. This capability will be added in a subsequent update.
- Token pools using the [Lock and Unlock mechanism](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-tokens#token-handling-mechanisms-and-token-pool-deployment), where tokens are locked on the source blockchain, and an equivalent amount of tokens are released on the destination blockchain.

## Getting started

1. Open the Token Manager, which has separate links for mainnet and testnet:

   - For mainnet, use [https://tokenmanager.chain.link/](https://tokenmanager.chain.link/)
   - For testnet, use `test.tokenmanager.chain.link`.

1. Connect your wallet using the **Connect wallet** button in the upper right corner.

After your wallet is connected, you'll see the Token Manager homepage.

## Deploy a new token

1. On the **Details** page, enter the details for the network you're using as the home chain for your token:
   - Select the network in the **Network** dropdown field.
   - Fill in the **Name** and **Symbol** fields to give your token its name and ticker symbol. For example, "Your Token" and "YOURS" respectively.
   - Click **Continue**.
1. On the **Settings** page, configure your token's supply:
   - You can enable and set a supply cap, which sets a maximum limit for the total number of tokens that can ever be minted.
   - Specify an amount of tokens to mint during this initial deployment step. If you set a supply cap, the amount of tokens you mint now must be less than or equal to the supply cap.
   - Click **Continue**.
1. On the **Networks** page, select the additional blockchain networks where you'd like to deploy your new token.
