<Aside type="note">
  Read the CCIP [manual execution](/ccip/concepts/manual-execution) conceptual page to understand how manual execution
  works under the hood.
</Aside>

This tutorial is similar to the [programmable token transfers example](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers). It demonstrates the use of Chainlink CCIP for transferring tokens and arbitrary data between smart contracts on different blockchains. A distinctive feature of this tutorial is that we intentionally set a very low gas limit when using CCIP to send our message. This low gas limit is designed to cause the execution on the destination chain to fail, providing an opportunity to demonstrate the manual execution feature. Here's how you will proceed:

1. Initiate a Transfer: You'll transfer tokens and arbitrary data from your source contract on Avalanche Fuji to a receiver contract on Ethereum Sepolia. You will notice that the CCIP message has a very low gas limit, causing the execution on the receiver contract to fail.
1. Failure of CCIP Message Delivery: Once the transaction is finalized on the source chain (Avalanche Fuji), CCIP will deliver your message to the receiver contract on the destination chain (Ethereum Sepolia). You can follow the progress of your transaction using the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/). Here, you'll observe that the execution on the receiver contract failed due to the low gas limit.
1. Manual Execution via CCIP Explorer: Using the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/), you will override the previously set gas limit and retry the execution. This process is referred to as _manual execution_.
1. Confirm Successful Execution: After manually executing the transaction with an adequate gas limit, you'll see that the status of your CCIP message is updated to successful. This indicates that the tokens and data were correctly transferred to the receiver contract.

## Before you begin

1. You should understand how to write, compile, deploy, and fund a smart contract. If you need to brush up on the basics, read this [tutorial](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract), which will guide you through using the [Solidity programming language](https://soliditylang.org/), interacting with the [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io) and working within the [Remix Development Environment](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
1. Your account must have some AVAX and LINK tokens on _Avalanche Fuji_ and ETH tokens on _Ethereum Sepolia_. Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
1. Check the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) to confirm that the tokens you will transfer are supported for your lane. In this example, you will transfer tokens from _Avalanche Fuji_ to _Ethereum Sepolia_ so check the list of supported tokens [here](/ccip/directory/testnet/chain/avalanche-fuji-testnet).
1. Learn how to [acquire CCIP test tokens](/ccip/test-tokens#mint-test-tokens). Following this guide, you should have CCIP-BnM tokens, and CCIP-BnM should appear in the list of your tokens in MetaMask.
1. Learn how to [fund your contract](/resources/fund-your-contract). This guide shows how to fund your contract in LINK, but you can use the same guide for funding your contract with any ERC20 tokens as long as they appear in the list of tokens in MetaMask.
1. Follow the previous tutorial: [_Transfer Tokens with Data_](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers) to learn how to make programmable token transfers using CCIP.
1. Create a free account on [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/). You will use Tenderly to investigate the failed execution of the receiver contract.

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll send a text _string_ and CCIP-BnM tokens between smart contracts on _Avalanche Fuji_ and _Ethereum Sepolia_ using CCIP and pay transaction fees in LINK. The tutorial demonstrates setting a deliberately low gas limit in the CCIP message, causing initial execution failure on the receiver contract. You will then:

1. Use the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/) to increase the gas limit.
1. Manually retry the execution.
1. Observe successful execution after the gas limit adjustment.

<CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/ProgrammableTokenTransfersLowGasLimit.sol" />

### Deploy your contracts

To use this contract:

1. [Open the contract in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/ProgrammableTokenTransfersLowGasLimit.sol).

1. Compile your contract.
1. Deploy, fund your sender contract on _Avalanche Fuji_ and enable sending messages to _Ethereum Sepolia_:

   1. Open MetaMask and select the network _Avalanche Fuji_.
   1. In Remix IDE, click on _Deploy & Run Transactions_ and select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ from the environment list. Remix will then interact with your MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Avalanche Fuji_.
   1. Fill in your blockchain's router and LINK contract addresses. The router address can be found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) and the LINK contract address on the [LINK token contracts page](/resources/link-token-contracts). For _Avalanche Fuji_:
      - The router address is <CopyText text="0xF694E193200268f9a4868e4Aa017A0118C9a8177" code/>,
      - The LINK contract address is <CopyText text="0x0b9d5D9136855f6FEc3c0993feE6E9CE8a297846" code/>.
   1. Click the **transact** button. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears on the _Deployed Contracts_ list.
      Note your contract address.
   1. Open MetaMask and fund your contract with CCIP-BnM tokens. You can transfer <CopyText text="0.002" code/> _CCIP-BnM_ to your contract.
   1. Open MetaMask and fund your contract with LINK tokens. You can transfer <CopyText text="70" code/> _LINK_ to your contract. In this example, LINK is used to pay the CCIP fees.

      **Note:** This transaction fee is significantly higher than normal due to gas spikes on Sepolia. To run this example, you can get additional testnet LINK
      from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link) or use a supported testnet other than Sepolia.

   1. Enable your contract to send CCIP messages to _Ethereum Sepolia_:
      1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of transactions of your smart contract deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_.
      1. Call the `allowlistDestinationChain` with <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/> as the destination chain selector, and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed. Each chain selector is found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory).

1. Deploy your receiver contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_ and enable receiving messages from your sender contract:

   1. Open MetaMask and select the network _Ethereum Sepolia_.
   1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, make sure the environment is still _Injected Provider - MetaMask_.
   1. Fill in your blockchain's router and LINK contract addresses. The router address can be found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) and the LINK contract address on the [LINK token contracts page](/resources/link-token-contracts). For _Ethereum Sepolia_:
      - The router address is <CopyText text="0x0BF3dE8c5D3e8A2B34D2BEeB17ABfCeBaf363A59" code/>,
      - The LINK contract address is <CopyText text="0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789" code/>.
   1. Click the **transact** button. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears on the _Deployed Contracts_ list.
      Note your contract address.
   1. Enable your contract to receive CCIP messages from _Avalanche Fuji_:
      1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of transactions of your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
      1. Call the `allowlistSourceChain` with <CopyText text="14767482510784806043" code/> as the source chain selector, and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed. Each chain selector is found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory).
   1. Enable your contract to receive CCIP messages from the contract that you deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_:
      1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of transactions of your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
      1. Call the `allowlistSender` with the contract address of the contract that you deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_, and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed.

At this point, you have one _sender_ contract on _Avalanche Fuji_ and one _receiver_ contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_. As security measures, you enabled the sender contract to send CCIP messages to _Ethereum Sepolia_ and the receiver contract to receive CCIP messages from the sender and _Avalanche Fuji_.

### Transfer and Receive tokens and data and pay in LINK

You will transfer _0.001 CCIP-BnM_ and a text. The CCIP fees for using CCIP will be paid in LINK.

1.  Send a string data with tokens from _Avalanche Fuji_:

    1.  Open MetaMask and select the network _Avalanche Fuji_.
    1.  In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of transactions of your smart contract deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_.
    1.  Fill in the arguments of the _**sendMessagePayLINK**_ function:

        <br />

        | Argument                   | Value and Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
        | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | \_destinationChainSelector | <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/> <br /> CCIP Chain identifier of the destination blockchain (_Ethereum Sepolia_ in this example). You can find each chain selector on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory).                                                |
        | \_receiver                 | Your receiver contract address at _Ethereum Sepolia_. <br /> The destination contract address.                                                                                                                                                                          |
        | \_text                     | <CopyText text="Hello World!" code/><br />Any `string`                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

You can find all the addresses for each supported blockchain on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory). |
        | \_amount                   | <CopyText text="1000000000000000" code/> <br /> The token amount (_0.001 CCIP-BnM_).                                                                                                                                                                                    |

    1.  Click on `transact` and confirm the transaction on MetaMask.
    1.  After the transaction is successful, record the transaction hash. Here is an [example](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/tx/0xfb7e1eea5335c018589166b1ac597b618a92899d99ec4d1b1079e147cde81d9b) of a transaction on _Avalanche Fuji_.

        <CcipCommon callout="gasSpike" />

1.  Open the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/) and search your cross-chain transaction using the transaction hash. Note that the _Gas Limit_ is _20000_. In this example, the CCIP message ID is _0xf8dc098c832332ac59ccc73ee00b480975d8f122a2265c90a1ccc2cd52268770_.

                <br />

            alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer transaction details"
          />

1.  After a few minutes, the status will be updated to _Ready for manual execution_ indicating that CCIP could not successfully deliver the message due to the initial low gas limit. At this stage, you have the option to override the gas limit.

                <br />

          <ClickToZoom
            src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-message-pay-link-tx-details-ready-manual-execution.jpg"
            alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer transaction details ready for manual execution"
          />

1.  You can also confirm that the CCIP message was not delivered to the receiver contract on the destination chain:

    1.  Open MetaMask and select the network _Ethereum Sepolia_.
    1.  In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of transactions of your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
    1.  Call the `getLastReceivedMessageDetails` function.

        <br />

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/sepolia-token-messagedetails-pay-link-failed.jpg"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Sepolia message details empty"
        />

    1.  Observe that the returned data is empty: the received messageId is _0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000_, indicating no message was received. Additionally, the received text field is empty, the token address is the default _0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000_, and the token amount shows as _0_.

### Manual execution

#### Investigate the root cause of receiver contract execution failure

To determine if a low gas limit is causing the failure in the receiver contract's execution, consider the following methods:

- Error analysis: Examine the error description in the CCIP explorer. An error labeled _ReceiverError. This may be due to an out of gas error on the destination chain. Error code: 0x_, often indicates a low gas issue.

- Advanced Investigation Tool: For a comprehensive analysis, employ a sophisticated tool like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/). Tenderly can provide detailed insights into the transaction processes, helping to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure.

To use [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/):

1.  Copy the destination transaction hash from the CCIP explorer. In this example, the destination transaction hash is _0x9f5b50460a1ab551add15dc4b743c81df992e34bc8140bbbdc033de7043140f5_.
1.  Open Tenderly and search for your transaction. You should see an interface similar to the following:

        <br />

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-message-manual-execution-tenderl1.jpg"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Sepolia open in Tenderly"
        />

1.  Enable _Full Trace_ then click on _Reverts_.

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-message-manual-execution-tenderly2.jpg"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Sepolia open in Tenderly"
        />

1.  Notice the _out of gas_ error in the receiver contract. In this example, the receiver contract is _0x47EAa31C9e2B1B1Ba19824BedcbE0014c15df15e_.

#### Trigger manual execution

You will increase the gas limit and trigger manual execution:

1.  In the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/), connect your wallet, set the _Gas limit override_ to <CopyText text="200000" code/>, and click on _Trigger Manual Execution_.

        <br />

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/sepolia-token-override-gas-limit.jpg"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Sepolia - override gas limit"
        />

1.  After you confirm the transaction on Metamask, the CCIP explorer shows you a confirmation screen.

        <br />

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-message-manual-execution-confirmation.jpg"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Sepolia - override gas limit - confirmation screen"
        />

1.  Click on the _Close_ button and observe the status marked as _Success_.

        <br />

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-message-manual-execution-success.jpg"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Sepolia - override gas limit - success"
        />

1.  Check the receiver contract on the destination chain:

    1.  Open MetaMask and select the network _Ethereum Sepolia_.
    1.  In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of transactions of your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
    1.  Call the `getLastReceivedMessageDetails` function.

        <br />

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/sepolia-token-messagedetails-pay-link-manual-success.jpg"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Sepolia message details - success"
        />

    1.  Notice the received messageId is _0xf8dc098c832332ac59ccc73ee00b480975d8f122a2265c90a1ccc2cd52268770_, the received text is _Hello World!_, the token address is _0xFd57b4ddBf88a4e07fF4e34C487b99af2Fe82a05_ (CCIP-BnM token address on _Ethereum Sepolia_) and the token amount is 1000000000000000 (0.001 CCIP-BnM).

**Note**: These example contracts are designed to work bi-directionally. As an exercise, you can use them to transfer tokens and data from _Avalanche Fuji_ to _Ethereum Sepolia_ and from _Ethereum Sepolia_ back to _Avalanche Fuji_.

## Explanation

<CcipCommon callout="importCCIPPackage" />

The smart contract used in this tutorial is configured to use CCIP for transferring and receiving tokens with data, similar to the contract in the [_Transfer Tokens with Data_](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers) tutorial. For a detailed understanding of the contract code, refer to the [code explanation](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers#explanation) section of that tutorial.

A key distinction in this tutorial is the intentional setup of a low gas limit of `20,000` for building the CCIP message. This specific gas limit setting is expected to fail the message delivery on the receiver contract in the destination chain:

```solidity
Client.EVMExtraArgsV2({
  gasLimit: 20_000
  allowOutOfOrderExecution: true
})
```

<CcipCommon callout="senderContractCallout" />
