This tutorial will guide you through the process of reconfiguring the rate limiter settings for outbound and inbound transfers in your deployed token pools using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). You will first review existing rate limiter settings and then reconfigure them.

## Prerequisites

- **Tokens and pools deployed**: Ensure that you have tokens and token pools already deployed on both networks you plan to use. If not, refer to one of the following tutorials:

  - [Register from an EOA (Burn & Mint)](/ccip/tutorials/ccip-enabled-tokens/register-from-eoa-burn-mint-hardhat)
  - [Register from an EOA (Lock & Mint)](/ccip/tutorials/ccip-enabled-tokens/register-from-eoa-lock-mint-hardhat)

- **Admin access**: You must have admin privileges for the token pool you intend to reconfigure.

## Before You Begin

1.  Make sure you have Node.js v18 or above installed. If not, **install Node.js v18**:  
    [Download Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it installed. Optionally, you can use the [nvm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) to switch between Node.js versions:

    ```bash
    nvm use 18
    ```

    Verify that the correct version of Node.js is installed:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    Example output:

    ```bash
    $ node -v
    v18.7.0
    ```

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-self-serve-tokens-poc.git
    cd ccip-self-serve-tokens-poc
    ```

1.  **Install dependencies for the project:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Compile the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run compile
    ```

1.  **Encrypt your environment variables for higher security:**  
    The project uses [@chainlink/env-enc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc) to encrypt your environment variables at rest. Follow the steps below to configure your environment securely:

    1. Set an encryption password for your environment variables:

       ```bash
       npx env-enc set-pw
       ```

    1. Set up a `.env.enc` file with the necessary variables for Avalanche Fuji and Arbitrum Sepolia testnets. Use the following command to add the variables:

       ```bash
       npx env-enc set
       ```

       Variables to configure:

       - `AVALANCHE_FUJI_RPC_URL`: A URL for the _Avalanche Fuji_ testnet. You can get a personal endpoint from services like [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).
       - `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key for your testnet wallet. If you use MetaMask, you can follow this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/) to export your private key. **Note:** This key is required for signing transactions like token transfers.

1.  **Fund your EOA with native gas tokens**:  
    Make sure your EOA has enough native gas tokens on Avalanche Fuji to cover transaction fees. You can use the [Chainlink faucets](https://faucets.chain.link/) to get testnet tokens.

### Review current rate limiter settings

Use the `getPoolConfig` task to fetch the current settings:

```bash
npx hardhat getPoolConfig --pooladdress <POOL_ADDRESS> --network <NETWORK_NAME>
```

Replace `<POOL_ADDRESS>` with your token pool address and `<NETWORK_NAME>` with the network (e.g., `avalancheFuji`).

Example:

```bash
npx hardhat getPoolConfig --pooladdress 0x41833AE7B0BCa169E090C752021070aC947d1821 --network avalancheFuji
```

Expected output:

```bash
info: Fetching configuration for pool at address: 0x02552EAE370aeb997015dA41398F0a53F693d77E
info: Configuration for Remote Chain: arbitrumSepolia
info:   Allowed: true
info:   Remote Pool Address: 0x41833AE7B0BCa169E090C752021070aC947d1821
info:   Remote Token Address: 0xf76a43fBe5fe929acc5F8596cf3BB52102f6eC52
info:   Outbound Rate Limiter:
info:     Enabled: false
info:     Capacity: 0
info:     Rate: 0
info:   Inbound Rate Limiter:
info:     Enabled: false
info:     Capacity: 0
info:     Rate: 0
```

In this example, the rate limiter settings are currently disabled for both outbound and inbound transfers.

### Reconfigure rate limiter settings

Use the `updateRateLimiters` task to modify the rate limiter configurations for an existing chain connection in your token pool. This task specifically interacts with the [`setChainRateLimiterConfig`](/ccip/api-reference/token-pool#setchainratelimiterconfig) function of the `TokenPool` contract, allowing you to adjust the rate limits without altering other configurations like remote pool addresses.

The `updateRateLimiters` task enables you to:

- Enable or disable rate limiting for both outbound and inbound transfers.
- Set the capacity and rate for the rate limiters, controlling the flow of tokens.
- Target a specific remote chain, updating rate limits for that chain only.

Below is an explanation of the parameters used during the rate limiter update process:

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                                                                                            | Default | Required |

| `remotechain`               | The remote blockchain to which this pool is linked. Examples include `avalancheFuji`, `arbitrumSepolia`, `baseSepolia`, and `sepolia`.                 | N/A     | Yes      |
| `outboundratelimitenabled`  | A flag indicating whether to enable outbound rate limits for cross-chain transfers (`true` or `false`).                                                | `false` | No       |
| `outboundratelimitcapacity` | The maximum number of tokens allowed in the bucket for outbound transfers (in wei). **Note**: Applicable if outbound rate limits are enabled.          | `0`     | No       |
| `outboundratelimitrate`     | The number of tokens per second that the bucket is refilled for outbound transfers (in wei). **Note**: Applicable if outbound rate limits are enabled. | `0`     | No       |
| `inboundratelimitenabled`   | A flag indicating whether to enable inbound rate limits for cross-chain transfers (`true` or `false`).                                                 | `false` | No       |
| `inboundratelimitcapacity`  | The maximum number of tokens allowed in the bucket for inbound transfers (in wei). **Note**: Applicable if inbound rate limits are enabled.            | `0`     | No       |
| `inboundratelimitrate`      | The number of tokens per second that the bucket is refilled for inbound transfers (in wei). **Note**: Applicable if inbound rate limits are enabled.   | `0`     | No       |
| `network`                   | The blockchain network where the local token pool is deployed. Examples include `avalancheFuji`, `arbitrumSepolia`, `baseSepolia`, and `sepolia`.      | N/A     | Yes      |

**Command syntax**:

```bash
npx hardhat updateRateLimiters \
  --pooladdress <POOL_ADDRESS> \
  --remotechain <REMOTE_CHAIN> \
  --outboundratelimitenabled <true/false> \
  --outboundratelimitcapacity <OUTBOUND_CAPACITY> \
  --outboundratelimitrate <OUTBOUND_RATE> \
  --inboundratelimitenabled <true/false> \
  --inboundratelimitcapacity <INBOUND_CAPACITY> \
  --inboundratelimitrate <INBOUND_RATE> \
  --network <NETWORK_NAME>
```

**Example command**:

Suppose you want to configure your token pool on Avalanche Fuji to interact with Arbitrum Sepolia, enabling rate limits as follows:

- Outbound Rate Limiter:
  - Enabled: `true`
  - Capacity: `1000000000000000000000` (1,000 tokens in wei)
  - Rate: `10000000000000000000` (10 tokens per second in wei)
- Inbound Rate Limiter:
  - Enabled: true
  - Capacity: `2000000000000000000000` (2,000 tokens in wei)
  - Rate: `20000000000000000000` (20 tokens per second in wei)

Use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat updateRateLimiters \
  --pooladdress 0x02552EAE370aeb997015dA41398F0a53F693d77E \
  --remotechain arbitrumSepolia \
  --outboundratelimitenabled true \
  --outboundratelimitcapacity 1000000000000000000000 \
  --outboundratelimitrate 10000000000000000000 \
  --inboundratelimitenabled true \
  --inboundratelimitcapacity 2000000000000000000000 \
  --inboundratelimitrate 20000000000000000000 \
  --network avalancheFuji
```

Expected output:

```bash
info: Updating rate limiters for token pool: 0x02552EAE370aeb997015dA41398F0a53F693d77E and chain selector: 3478487238524512106 (arbitrumSepolia)
info: Rate limiters updated successfully
```

### Verify the new rate limiter settings

After applying the new rate limiter settings, verify that they have been updated correctly.

Use the `getPoolConfig` task again:

```bash
npx hardhat getPoolConfig --pooladdress 0x02552EAE370aeb997015dA41398F0a53F693d77E --network avalancheFuji
```

Expected output:

```bash
info: Fetching configuration for pool at address: 0x02552EAE370aeb997015dA41398F0a53F693d77E
info: Configuration for Remote Chain: arbitrumSepolia
info:   Allowed: true
info:   Remote Pool Address: 0x41833AE7B0BCa169E090C752021070aC947d1821
info:   Remote Token Address: 0xf76a43fBe5fe929acc5F8596cf3BB52102f6eC52
info:   Outbound Rate Limiter:
info:     Enabled: true
info:     Capacity: 1000000000000000000000
info:     Rate: 10000000000000000000
info:   Inbound Rate Limiter:
info:     Enabled: true
info:     Capacity: 2000000000000000000000
info:     Rate: 20000000000000000000
```

You have successfully reconfigured the rate limiter settings for outbound and inbound transfers in your token pools.
