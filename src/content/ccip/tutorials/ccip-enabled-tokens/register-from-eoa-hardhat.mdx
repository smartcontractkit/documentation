This tutorial will guide you through the process of enabling your own tokens in CCIP using Hardhat. You will learn how to deploy tokens, deploy token pools, register them in CCIP, and configure them without needing direct intervention from Chainlink Labs.

We will cover the following key steps:

1. **Deploying Tokens**: You will deploy your tokens on the Avalanche Fuji and Ethereum Sepolia testnets.
1. **Deploying Token Pools**: Once your tokens are deployed, you will create token pools on Avalanche Fuji and Ethereum Sepolia. These pools are essential for minting and burning tokens during cross-chain transfers. Each token will be associated with a pool, which will manage token transfers and ensure proper handling of assets across chains.

1. **Claiming Mint and Burn Roles**: You will claim the mint and burn roles for the token pools, giving your token pools control over how tokens are minted and burned during cross-chain token transfers.

1. **Claiming and Accepting the Admin Role**: You will claim the administrator role for the deployed tokens and token pools. This role allows you to enable your token in CCIP. Once claimed, you will accept the admin role and complete the registration process.

1. **Linking Tokens to Pools**: You will associate each token with its respective token pool.

1. **Configuring Token Pools**: You will configure each token pool by setting cross-chain transfer parameters, such as token pool rate limits and enabled destination chains.

1. **Minting Tokens**: You will mint tokens on Avalanche Fuji for your EOA. These tokens will later be used to test cross-chain transfers to Ethereum Sepolia.

1. **Transferring Tokens**: Finally, you will transfer tokens from Avalanche Fuji to Ethereum Sepolia using CCIP. You will have the option to pay CCIP fees in either LINK tokens or native gas tokens.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have successfully deployed, registered, configured, and enabled your tokens and token pools for use in CCIP.
