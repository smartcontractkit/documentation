This tutorial will teach you how to use Chainlink CCIP to send arbitrary data between smart contracts on different blockchains and how to track the status of each sent message in the sender contract on the source chain. Tracking the status of sent messages allows your smart contracts to execute actions after the receiver acknowledges it received the message. In this example, the sender contract emits an event after it receives acknowledgment from the receiver.

**Note**: For simplicity, this tutorial demonstrates this pattern for sending arbitrary data. However, you are not limited to this application. You can apply the same pattern to programmable token transfers.

## Before you begin

- This tutorial assumes you have completed the [Send Arbitrary Data](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data) tutorial.
- Your account must have some AVAX tokens on _Avalanche Fuji_ and ETH tokens on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
- Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link) and [Fund your contract with LINK](/resources/fund-your-contract).

## Tutorial

<CcipCommon callout="useSimulator" />

In this tutorial, you will deploy a _message tracker_ contract on the source blockchain (Avalanche Fuji) and an _acknowledger_ on the destination blockchain (Ethereum Sepolia). Throughout the tutorial, you will pay for CCIP fees using LINK tokens. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sending and building a CCIP message:** Initiate and send a message from the _message tracker_ contract on Avalanche Fuji to the _acknowledger_ contract on Ethereum Sepolia. The _message tracker_ contract constructs a CCIP message that encapsulates a text string and establishes a tracking status for this message before sending it off.
1. **Receiving and acknowledging the message:** After the _acknowledger_ contract receives the text on Ethereum Sepolia, it sends back a CCIP message to the _message tracker_ contract as an acknowledgment of receipt.
1. **Updating tracking status:** After the _message tracker_ receives the acknowledgment, the contract updates the tracking status of the initial CCIP message and emits an event to signal completion.

### Deploy the _message tracker_ (sender) contract

Deploy the `MessageTracker.sol` contract on _Avalanche Fuji_ and enable it to send and receive CCIP messages to and from _Ethereum Sepolia_. You must also enable your contract to receive CCIP messages from the _acknowledger_ contract.

1. [Open the MessageTracker.sol contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/MessageTracker.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/MessageTracker.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

   Note: The contract code is also available in the [Examine the code](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data-receipt-acknowledgment#messagetrackersol) section.

1. Compile the contract.

1. Deploy the contract on _Avalanche Fuji_:

   1. Open MetaMask and select the _Avalanche Fuji_ network.
   1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Avalanche Fuji_.
   1. Under the **Deploy** section, fill in the router address and the LINK token contract address for your specific blockchain. You can find both of these addresses on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory). The LINK token contract address is also listed on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page. For _Avalanche Fuji_:

      - The router address is <CopyText text="0xF694E193200268f9a4868e4Aa017A0118C9a8177" code/>
      - The LINK token address is <CopyText text="0x0b9d5D9136855f6FEc3c0993feE6E9CE8a297846" code/>

   1. Click **transact** to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract on _Avalanche Fuji_.

   1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Copy your contract address.

   1. Open MetaMask and send <CopyText text="70" code/> LINK to the contract address you copied. Your contract will pay CCIP fees in LINK.

      **Note:** This transaction fee is significantly higher than normal due to gas spikes on Sepolia. To run this example, you can get additional testnet LINK
      from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link) or use a supported testnet other than Sepolia.

1. Allow the _Ethereum Sepolia_ chain selector for both destination and source chains.

   1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
   1. Call the `allowlistDestinationChain` function with <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/> as the destination chain selector for _Ethereum Sepolia_ and <CopyText text="true" code /> as allowed.
   1. Call the `allowlistSourceChain` function with <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/> as the source chain selector for _Ethereum Sepolia_ and <CopyText text="true" code /> as allowed.
      You can find each network's chain selector on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory).

### Deploy the acknowledger (receiver) contract

Deploy the `Acknowledger.sol` contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_ and enable it to send and receive CCIP messages to and from _Avalanche Fuji_. You must also enable your contract to receive CCIP messages from the _message tracker_ contract.

1.  [Open the Acknowledger.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Acknowledger.sol) contract in Remix.

    <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Acknowledger.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

    Note: The contract code is also available in the [Examine the code](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data-receipt-acknowledgment#acknowledgersol) section.

1.  Compile the contract.

1.  Deploy the contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_:

    1. Open MetaMask and select the _Ethereum Sepolia_ network.

    1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, make sure the **Environment** is still set to _Injected Provider - MetaMask_.
    1. Under the **Deploy** section, fill in the router address and the LINK token contract address for your specific blockchain. You can find both of these addresses on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory). The LINK token contract address is also listed on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page. For _Ethereum Sepolia_:

       - The Router address is <CopyText text="0x0BF3dE8c5D3e8A2B34D2BEeB17ABfCeBaf363A59" code/>.
       - The LINK token address is <CopyText text="0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789" code/>.

    1. Click **transact** to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract to _Ethereum Sepolia_.

    1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Copy this contract address.

    1. Open MetaMask and send <CopyText text="70" code/> LINK to the contract address that you copied. Your contract will pay CCIP fees in LINK.

       **Note:** This transaction fee is significantly higher than normal due to gas spikes on Sepolia. To run this example, you can get additional testnet LINK
       from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link) or use a supported testnet other than Sepolia.

1.  Allow the _Avalanche Fuji_ chain selector for both destination and source chains. You must also enable your acknowledger contract to receive CCIP messages from the message tracker you deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_.

    1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the _acknowledger_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section. Expand the `allowlistDestinationChain`, `allowlistSender`, and `allowlistSourceChain` functions and fill in the following arguments:

       | Function                  | Description                                                                                                                         | Value (_Avalanche Fuji_)                                                   |
       | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
       | allowlistDestinationChain | CCIP Chain identifier of the target blockchain. You can find each network's chain selector on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) | <CopyText text="14767482510784806043" code/>, <CopyText text="true" code/> |
       | allowlistSender           | The address of the message tracker contract deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_                                                            | Your deployed contract address, <CopyText text="true" code/>               |
       | allowlistSourceChain      | CCIP Chain identifier of the source blockchain. You can find each network's chain selector on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) | <CopyText text="14767482510784806043" code/>, <CopyText text="true" code/> |

    1. Open MetaMask and select the _Ethereum Sepolia_ network.
    1. For each function you expanded and filled in the arguments for, click the **transact** button to call the function. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Wait for each transaction to succeed before calling the following function.

1.  Finally, enable your _message tracker_ contract to receive CCIP messages from the _acknowledger_ contract you deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.

    1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section. Expand the `allowlistSender` function and fill in your _acknowledger_ contract address and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed.

    1. Open MetaMask and select the _Avalanche Fuji_ network.
    1. Click **transact** to call the function. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

At this point, you have one _message tracker_ (sender) contract on _Avalanche Fuji_ and one _acknowledger_ (receiver) contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_. You sent `70` LINK to the _message tracker_ contract and `70` LINK to the _acknowledger_ contract to pay the CCIP fees.

**Note:** This transaction fee is significantly higher than normal due to gas spikes on Sepolia.

### Send data and track the message status

#### Initial message

1. Send a `Hello World!` string from your _message tracker_ contract on _Avalanche Fuji_ to your _acknowledger_ contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_. You will track the status of this message during this tutorial.

   1. Open MetaMask and select the _Avalanche Fuji_ network.
   1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand the _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
   1. Expand the **sendMessagePayLINK** function and fill in the following arguments:

      | Argument                 | Description                                                                                                                         | Value (_Ethereum Sepolia_)                    |
      | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
      | destinationChainSelector | CCIP Chain identifier of the target blockchain. You can find each network's chain selector on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) | <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/>  |
      | receiver                 | The destination smart contract address                                                                                              | Your deployed _acknowledger_ contract address |
      | text                     | Any `string`                                                                                                                        | <CopyText text="Hello World!" code/>          |

   1. Click **transact** to call the function. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

      <CcipCommon callout="gasSpike" />

   1. Upon transaction success, expand the last transaction in the Remix log and copy the transaction hash. In this example, it is `0x1f88abc33a4ab426a5466e01d9e5fe8a2b96d6a6e5cedb643a674489c74126b4`.

1. Open the [CCIP Explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/) and use the transaction hash that you copied to search for your cross-chain transaction.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-fuji-sepolia.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer - Fuji to Sepolia Transaction Details"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   After the transaction is finalized on the source chain, it will take a few minutes for CCIP to deliver the data to _Ethereum Sepolia_ and call the `ccipReceive` function on your _acknowledger_ contract.

1. Copy the message ID from the CCIP Explorer transaction details. You will use this message ID to track your message status on the _message tracker_ contract. In this example, it is `0xdd8be2f5f5d5cf3b8640c62924025b311ae83c6144f0f2ed5c24637436d6aab8`.

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand your _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1. Paste the message ID you copied from the CCIP explorer as the argument in the **messagesInfo** getter function. Click **messagesInfo** to read the message status.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/message-tracker-message-status-1.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Get Message Status - 1"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   Note the returned `status 1`. This value indicates that the _message tracker_ contract has updated your message status to the `Sent` status as defined by the `MessageStatus` `enum` in the _message tracker_ contract.

   ```solidity
   // Enum is used to track the status of messages sent via CCIP.
   // `NotSent` indicates a message has not yet been sent.
   // `Sent` indicates that a message has been sent to the Acknowledger contract but not yet acknowledged.
   // `ProcessedOnDestination` indicates that the Acknowledger contract has processed the message and that
   // the Message Tracker contract has received the acknowledgment from the Acknowledger contract.
   enum MessageStatus {
     NotSent, // 0
     Sent, // 1
     ProcessedOnDestination // 2
   }
   ```

1. When the transaction is marked with a "Success" status on the [CCIP Explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/), the CCIP transaction and the destination transaction are complete. The _acknowledger_ contract has received the message from the _message tracker_ contract.

   <ClickToZoom

     alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer - Fuji to Sepolia Transaction Success"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

#### Acknowledgment message

The _acknowledger_ contract processes the message, sends an acknowledgment message containing the initial message ID back to the _message tracker_ contract, and emits an `AcknowledgmentSent` event. Read this [explanation](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data-receipt-acknowledgment#acknowledger-contract) for further description.

```solidity
// Emitted when an acknowledgment message is successfully sent back to the sender contract.
// This event signifies that the Acknowledger contract has recognized the receipt of an initial message
// and has informed the original sender contract by sending an acknowledgment message,
// including the original message ID.
event AcknowledgmentSent(
  bytes32 indexed messageId, // The unique ID of the CCIP message.
  uint64 indexed destinationChainSelector, // The chain selector of the destination chain.
  address indexed receiver, // The address of the receiver on the destination chain.
  bytes32 data, // The data being sent back, usually containing the message ID of the original message to acknowledge its receipt.
  address feeToken, // The token address used to pay CCIP fees for sending the acknowledgment.
  uint256 fees // The fees paid for sending the acknowledgment message via CCIP.
);
```

1. Copy your _acknowledger_ contract address from Remix. Open the [_Ethereum Sepolia_ explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) and search for your deployed _acknowledger_ contract. Click the **Events** tab to see the events log.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ethereum-sepolia-explorer-acknowledger-events.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - Ethereum Sepolia Acknowledger Contract Events"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   The first indexed topic (`topic1`) in the `AcknowledgmentSent` event is the acknowledgment message ID sent to the _message tracker_ contract on _Avalanche Fuji_. In this example, the message ID is `0xd4d4a5d0db05dc714f8150c1af654ed34eb8c9f7547401fa9bf072a815f56ac1`.

1. Copy your own message ID from the indexed `topic1` and search for it in the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/).

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-sepolia-fuji-success.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - CCIP Explorer Sepolia to Fuji Transaction Success"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   When the transaction is marked with a "Success" status on the CCIP explorer, the CCIP transaction and the destination transaction are complete. The _message tracker_ contract has received the message from the _acknowledger_ contract.

#### Final status check

When the _message tracker_ receives the acknowledgment message, the `ccipReceive` function updates the initial message status to `2`, which corresponds to the `ProcessedOnDestination` status as defined by the `MessageStatus` `enum`. The function emits a `MessageProcessedOnDestination` event.

1. Open MetaMask and select the _Avalanche Fuji_ network.

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, expand your _message tracker_ contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1. Copy the **initial message ID** from the CCIP explorer (transaction from _Avalanche Fuji_ to _Ethereum Sepolia_) and paste it as the argument in the **messagesInfo** getter function. Click **messagesInfo** to read the message status. It returns `status 2` and the acknowledgment message ID that confirms this status.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/message-tracker-message-status-2.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Get Message Status - 2"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Copy your _message tracker_ contract address from Remix. Open the [_Avalanche Fuji_ explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/) and search for your deployed _message tracker_ contract. Then, click on the **Events** tab.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/ccip/tutorials/message-tracker-messageconfirmed-event.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink CCIP - Message Tracker Message Confirmed Event"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   The `MessageProcessedOnDestination` event is emitted with the acknowledged message ID `0xdd8be2f5f5d5cf3b8640c62924025b311ae83c6144f0f2ed5c24637436d6aab8` as indexed `topic2`.

   ```solidity
   // Event emitted when the sender contract receives an acknowledgment
   // that the receiver contract has successfully received and processed the message.
   event MessageProcessedOnDestination(
     bytes32 indexed messageId, // The unique ID of the CCIP acknowledgment message.
     bytes32 indexed acknowledgedMsgId, // The unique ID of the message acknowledged by the receiver.
     uint64 indexed sourceChainSelector, // The chain selector of the source chain.
     address sender // The address of the sender from the source chain.
   );
   ```

## Explanation

<CcipCommon callout="importCCIPPackage" />

The smart contracts featured in this tutorial are designed to interact with CCIP to send and receive messages with an acknowledgment of receipt mechanism. The contract code across both contracts contains supporting comments clarifying the functions, events, and underlying logic.

Refer to the [Send Arbitrary Data](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#explanation) tutorial for more explanation about [initializing the contracts](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#initializing-of-the-contract), [sending data, paying in LINK](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#sending-data-and-pay-in-link), and [receiving data](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#receiving-data).

Here, we will further explain the acknowledgment of receipt mechanism.

<CcipCommon callout="senderContractCallout" />

### Message acknowledgment of receipt mechanism

This mechanism ensures that a message sent by the _message tracker_ (sender) contract is received and acknowledged by the _acknowledger_ (receiver) contract. The message status is tracked and stored in the _message tracker_ contract.

```solidity
// Enum is used to track the status of messages sent via CCIP.
// `NotSent` indicates a message has not yet been sent.
// `Sent` indicates that a message has been sent to the Acknowledger contract but not yet acknowledged.
// `ProcessedOnDestination` indicates that the Acknowledger contract has processed the message and that
// the Message Tracker contract has received the acknowledgment from the Acknowledger contract.
enum MessageStatus {
    NotSent, // 0
    Sent, // 1
    ProcessedOnDestination // 2
}

// Struct to store the status and acknowledger message ID of a message.
struct MessageInfo {
    MessageStatus status;
    bytes32 acknowledgerMessageId;
}

// Mapping to keep track of message IDs to their info (status & acknowledger message ID).
mapping(bytes32 => MessageInfo) public messagesInfo;
```

#### _Message tracker_ contract

The _message tracker_ contract acts as the sender, initiating cross-chain communication. It performs the following operations:

- **Message sending**: Constructs and sends messages to the _acknowledger_ contract on another blockchain, using [`sendMessagePayLINK`](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#sending-data-and-pay-in-link) function. On top of its [five primary operations](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#sending-data-and-pay-in-link), the [`sendMessagePayLINK`](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#sending-data-and-pay-in-link) function also updates the message status upon sending.

- **Status tracking**:

  - Upon sending a message, the _message tracker_ updates its internal state to mark the message as `Sent` (status `1`). This status is pivotal for tracking the message lifecycle and awaiting acknowledgment.

    ```solidity
    // Update the message status to `Sent`
    messagesInfo[messageId].status = MessageStatus.Sent;
    ```

  - Upon receiving an acknowledgment message from the _acknowledger_ contract, the _message tracker_ contract updates the message status from `Sent` (status `1`) to `ProcessedOnDestination` (status `2`). This update indicates that the cross-chain communication cycle is complete, and the receiver successfully received and acknowledged the message.

    ```solidity
    // Update the message status to `ProcessedOnDestination`
    messagesInfo[messageId].status = MessageStatus.ProcessedOnDestination;
    ```

#### _Acknowledger_ contract

The _acknowledger_ contract receives the message, sends back an acknowledgment message, and emits an event. It performs the following operations:

- **Message receipt**: Upon receiving a message via CCIP, the `ccipReceive` function decodes it and calls the `acknowledgePayLINK` function nested within the [`ccipReceive`](/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#receiving-data) function.

- **Acknowledgment sending**: The `acknowledgePayLINK` function acts as a custom [`sendMessagePayLINK`](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/send-arbitrary-data#sending-data-and-pay-in-link) function nested within the `ccipReceive` function. It sends
  an acknowledgment (a CCIP message) to the _message tracker_ contract upon the initial message receipt. The data transferred in this acknowledgment message is the initial message ID. It then emits an `AcknowledgmentSent` event.

### Security and integrity

Both contracts use allowlists to process only messages from and to allowed sources.

- **Allowlisting chains and senders**:

  - The `sendMessagePayLINK` function is protected by the `onlyAllowlistedDestinationChain` modifier, ensuring the contract owner has allowlisted a destination chain.
  - The `ccipReceive` function is protected by the `onlyAllowlisted` modifier, ensuring the contract owner has allowlisted a source chain and a sender.

- **Ensuring the initial message authenticity**: The _message tracker_ contract first checks that the message awaiting acknowledgment was sent from the contract itself and is currently marked as `Sent`. Once confirmed, the message status is updated to `ProcessedOnDestination`.

## Examine the code

### MessageTracker.sol

<CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/MessageTracker.sol" />

### Acknowledger.sol

<CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Acknowledger.sol" />

## Final note

In this example, the _message tracker_ contract emits an event when it receives the acknowledgment message confirming the initial message reception and processing on the counterpart chain. However, you could think of any other logic to execute when the _message tracker_ receives the acknowledgment. This tutorial demonstrates the pattern for sending arbitrary data, but you can apply the same pattern to programmable token transfers.
