This tutorial extends the [programmable token transfers example](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers). It uses Chainlink CCIP to transfer tokens and arbitrary data between smart contracts on different blockchains, and focuses on defensive coding in the receiver contract. In the event of a specified error during the CCIP message reception, the contract locks the tokens. Locking the tokens allows the owner to recover and redirect them as needed. Defensive coding is crucial as it enables the recovery of locked tokens and ensures the protection of your users' assets.

<Aside type="caution" title="Transferring tokens">
  This tutorial uses the term "transferring tokens" even though the tokens are not technically transferred. Instead,
  they are locked or burned on the source chain and then unlocked or minted on the destination chain. Read the [Token
  Pools](/ccip/architecture#token-pools) section to understand the various mechanisms that are used to transfer value
  across chains.

## Before you begin

1. You should understand how to write, compile, deploy, and fund a smart contract. If you need to brush up on the basics, read this [tutorial](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract), which will guide you through using the [Solidity programming language](https://soliditylang.org/), interacting with the [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io) and working within the [Remix Development Environment](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
1. Your account must have some AVAX and LINK tokens on _Avalanche Fuji_ and ETH tokens on _Ethereum Sepolia_. Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
1. Check the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) to confirm that the tokens you will transfer are supported for your lane. In this example, you will transfer tokens from _Avalanche Fuji_ to _Ethereum Sepolia_ so check the list of supported tokens [here](/ccip/directory/testnet/chain/avalanche-fuji-testnet).
1. Learn how to [acquire CCIP test tokens](/ccip/test-tokens#mint-test-tokens). Following this guide, you should have CCIP-BnM tokens, and CCIP-BnM should appear in the list of your tokens in MetaMask.
1. Learn how to [fund your contract](/resources/fund-your-contract). This guide shows how to fund your contract in LINK, but you can use the same guide for funding your contract with any ERC20 tokens as long as they appear in the list of tokens in MetaMask.
1. Follow the previous tutorial: [_Transfer Tokens with Data_](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers) to learn how to make programmable token transfers using CCIP.

## Tutorial

<CcipCommon callout="useSimulator" />

In this guide, you'll initiate a transaction from a smart contract on _Avalanche Fuji_, sending a _string_ text and CCIP-BnM tokens to another smart contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_ using CCIP. However, a deliberate failure in the processing logic will occur upon reaching the receiver contract. This tutorial will demonstrate a graceful error-handling approach, allowing the contract owner to recover the locked tokens.

<Aside type="note" title="Correctly estimate your gas limit">
  It is crucial to thoroughly test all scenarios to accurately estimate the required gas limit, including for failure
  scenarios. Be aware that the gas used to execute the error-handling logic for failure scenarios may be higher than
  that for successful scenarios.

### Deploy your contracts

To use this contract:

1. [Open the contract in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/ProgrammableDefensiveTokenTransfers.sol).

1. Compile your contract.
1. Deploy, fund your sender contract on _Avalanche Fuji_ and enable sending messages to _Ethereum Sepolia_:

   1. Open MetaMask and select the network _Avalanche Fuji_.
   1. In Remix IDE, click on _Deploy & Run Transactions_ and select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ from the environment list. Remix will then interact with your MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Avalanche Fuji_.
   1. Fill in your blockchain's router and LINK contract addresses. The router address can be found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) and the LINK contract address on the [LINK token contracts page](/resources/link-token-contracts). For _Avalanche Fuji_:
      - The router address is <CopyText text="0xF694E193200268f9a4868e4Aa017A0118C9a8177" code/>,
      - The LINK contract address is <CopyText text="0x0b9d5D9136855f6FEc3c0993feE6E9CE8a297846" code/>.
   1. Click the **transact** button. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears on the _Deployed Contracts_ list.
      Note your contract address.
   1. Open MetaMask and fund your contract with CCIP-BnM tokens. You can transfer <CopyText text="0.002" code/> _CCIP-BnM_ to your contract.
   1. Enable your contract to send CCIP messages to _Ethereum Sepolia_:
      1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of functions of your smart contract deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_.
      1. Call the `allowlistDestinationChain` with <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/> as the destination chain selector, and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed. Each chain selector is found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory).

1. Deploy your receiver contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_ and enable receiving messages from your sender contract:

   1. Open MetaMask and select the network _Ethereum Sepolia_.
   1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, make sure the environment is still _Injected Provider - MetaMask_.
   1. Fill in your blockchain's router and LINK contract addresses. The router address can be found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) and the LINK contract address on the [LINK token contracts page](/resources/link-token-contracts). For _Ethereum Sepolia_:
      - The router address is <CopyText text="0x0BF3dE8c5D3e8A2B34D2BEeB17ABfCeBaf363A59" code/>,
      - The LINK contract address is <CopyText text="0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789" code/>.
   1. Click the **transact** button. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears on the _Deployed Contracts_ list.
      Note your contract address.
   1. Enable your contract to receive CCIP messages from _Avalanche Fuji_:
      1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of functions of your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
      1. Call the `allowlistSourceChain` with <CopyText text="14767482510784806043" code/> as the source chain selector, and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed. Each chain selector is found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory).
   1. Enable your contract to receive CCIP messages from the contract that you deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_:
      1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of functions of your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
      1. Call the `allowlistSender` with the contract address of the contract that you deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_, and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed.
   1. Call the `setSimRevert` function, passing `true` as a parameter, then wait for the transaction to confirm. Setting `s_simRevert` to true simulates a failure when processing the received message. Read the [explanation](#explanation) section for more details.

At this point, you have one _sender_ contract on _Avalanche Fuji_ and one _receiver_ contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_. As security measures, you enabled the sender contract to send CCIP messages to _Ethereum Sepolia_ and the receiver contract to receive CCIP messages from the sender on _Avalanche Fuji_. The receiver contract cannot process the message, and therefore, instead of throwing an exception, it will lock the received tokens, enabling the owner to recover them.

**Note**: Another security measure enforces that only the router can call the `_ccipReceive` function. Read the [explanation](#explanation) section for more details.

### Recover the locked tokens

You will transfer _0.001 CCIP-BnM_ and a text. The CCIP fees for using CCIP will be paid in LINK.

1.  Open MetaMask and connect to _Avalanche Fuji_. Fund your contract with LINK tokens. You can transfer <CopyText text="70" code/> _LINK_ to your contract. In this example, LINK is used to pay the CCIP fees.

    **Note:** This transaction fee is significantly higher than normal due to gas spikes on Sepolia. To run this example, you can get additional testnet LINK
    from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link) or use a supported testnet other than Sepolia.

1.  Send a string data with tokens from _Avalanche Fuji_:

    1.  Open MetaMask and select the network _Avalanche Fuji_.
    1.  In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of functions of your smart contract deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_.
    1.  Fill in the arguments of the _**sendMessagePayLINK**_ function:

        <br />

        | Argument                   | Value and Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

You can find each chain selector on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory).                                                |
        | \_receiver                 | Your receiver contract address at _Ethereum Sepolia_. <br /> The destination contract address.                                                                                                                                                                          |
        | \_text                     | <CopyText text="Hello World!" code/><br />Any `string`                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
        | \_token                    | <CopyText text="0xD21341536c5cF5EB1bcb58f6723cE26e8D8E90e4" code/><br /> The _CCIP-BnM_ contract address at the source chain (_Avalanche Fuji_ in this example). You can find all the addresses for each supported blockchain on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory). |
        | \_amount                   | <CopyText text="1000000000000000" code/> <br /> The token amount (_0.001 CCIP-BnM_).                                                                                                                                                                                    |

    1.  Click on `transact` and confirm the transaction on MetaMask.
    1.  After the transaction is successful, record the transaction hash. Here is an [example](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/tx/0x4c7a192fa5636557569d076c06633c4f06140f117a44b49f21628eedd72b8423) of a transaction on _Avalanche Fuji_.

        <CcipCommon callout="gasSpike" />

1.  Open the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/) and search your cross-chain transaction using the transaction hash.

                <br />

          <ClickToZoom
            src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-message-pay-link-tx-details-defensive.webp"
            alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer transaction details"
          />

1.  The CCIP transaction is completed once the status is marked as "Success". In this example, the CCIP message ID is _0x120367995ef71f83d64a05bd7793862afda9d04049da4cb32851934490d03ae4_.

                <br />

          <ClickToZoom
            src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-message-pay-link-tx-details-success-defensive.webp"
            alt="Chainlink CCIP Explorer transaction details success"
          />

1.  Check the receiver contract on the destination chain:

    1.  Open MetaMask and select the network _Ethereum Sepolia_.
    1.  In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of functions of your smart contract deployed on _Ethereum Sepolia_.
    1.  Call the `getFailedMessages` function with an _offset_ of <CopyText text="0" code/> and a _limit_ of <CopyText text="1" code/> to retrieve the first failed message.

        <br />

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-lastfailedmessageids-defensive.webp"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Fuji last failed message ids"
        />

    1.  Notice the returned values are: _0x120367995ef71f83d64a05bd7793862afda9d04049da4cb32851934490d03ae4_ (the message ID) and _1_ (the error code indicating failure).

1.  To recover the locked tokens, call the `retryFailedMessage` function:

    | Argument        | Description                                   |
    | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | `messageId`     | The unique identifier of the failed message.  |
    | `tokenReceiver` | The address to which the tokens will be sent. |

        <br />

        <ClickToZoom
          src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-ccip-retry-failed-defensive.webp"
          alt="Chainlink CCIP Sepolia retry failed message id"
        />

1.  After confirming the transaction, you can open it in a block explorer. Notice that the locked funds were transferred to the `tokenReceiver` address.

                <br />

          <ClickToZoom
            src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-ccip-retry-failed-tokens-transferred-defensive.webp"
            alt="Chainlink CCIP retry failed message - tokens transferred"
          />

1.  Call again the `getFailedMessages` function with an _offset_ of <CopyText text="0" code/> and a _limit_ of <CopyText text="1" code/> to retrieve the first failed message. Notice that the error code is now _0_, indicating that the message was resolved.

                <br />

          <ClickToZoom
            src="/images/ccip/tutorials/ccip-explorer-send-tokens-lastfailedmessageids-defensive-recovered.webp"
            alt="Chainlink CCIP retry failed message - tokens transferred - recovered"
          />

**Note**: These example contracts are designed to work bi-directionally. As an exercise, you can use them to transfer tokens with data from _Avalanche Fuji_ to _Ethereum Sepolia_ and from _Ethereum Sepolia_ back to _Avalanche Fuji_.

## Explanation

<CcipCommon callout="importCCIPPackage" />

The smart contract featured in this tutorial is designed to interact with CCIP to transfer and receive tokens and data. The contract code is similar to the [_Transfer Tokens with Data_](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers) tutorial. Hence, you can refer to its [code explanation](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers#explanation). We will only explain the main differences.

### Sending messages

<CcipCommon callout="senderContractCallout" />

The `sendMessagePayLINK` function is similar to the `sendMessagePayLINK` function in the [_Transfer Tokens with Data_](/ccip/tutorials/programmable-token-transfers) tutorial. The main difference is the increased gas limit to account for the additional gas required to process the error-handling logic.

### Receiving and processing messages

Upon receiving a message on the destination blockchain, the `ccipReceive` function is called by the CCIP router. This function serves as the entry point to the contract for processing incoming CCIP messages, enforcing crucial security checks through the `onlyRouter`, and `onlyAllowlisted` modifiers.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. Entrance through `ccipReceive`:

   - The `ccipReceive` function is invoked with an `Any2EVMMessage` [struct](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#any2evmmessage) containing the message to be processed.
   - Security checks ensure the call is from the authorized router, an allowlisted source chain, and an allowlisted sender.

1. Processing Message:

   - `ccipReceive` calls the `processMessage` function, which is external to leverage Solidity's try/catch error handling mechanism. **Note**: The `onlySelf` modifier ensures that only the contract can call this function.
   - Inside `processMessage`, a check is performed for a simulated revert condition using the `s_simRevert` state variable. This simulation is toggled by the `setSimRevert` function, callable only by the contract owner.
   - If `s_simRevert` is false, `processMessage` calls the `_ccipReceive` function for further message processing.

1. Message Processing in `_ccipReceive`:

   - `_ccipReceive` extracts and stores various information from the message, such as the `messageId`, decoded `sender` address, token amounts, and data.
   - It then emits a `MessageReceived` event, signaling the successful processing of the message.

1. Error Handling:
   - If an error occurs during the processing (or a simulated revert is triggered), the catch block within `ccipReceive` is executed.
   - The `messageId` of the failed message is added to `s_failedMessages`, and the message content is stored in `s_messageContents`.
   - A `MessageFailed` event is emitted, which allows for later identification and reprocessing of failed messages.

### Reprocessing of failed messages

The `retryFailedMessage` function provides a mechanism to recover assets if a CCIP message processing fails. It's specifically designed to handle scenarios where message data issues prevent entire processing yet allow for token recovery:

1. Initiation:

   - Only the contract owner can call this function, providing the `messageId` of the failed message and the `tokenReceiver` address for token recovery.

1. Validation:

   - It checks if the message has failed using `s_failedMessages.get(messageId)`. If not, it reverts the transaction.

1. Status Update:

   - The error code for the message is updated to `RESOLVED` to prevent reentry and multiple retries.

1. Token Recovery:

   - Retrieves the failed message content using `s_messageContents[messageId]`.
   - Transfers the locked tokens associated with the failed message to the specified `tokenReceiver` as an escape hatch without processing the entire message again.

1. **Event Emission**:
   - An event `MessageRecovered` is emitted to signal the successful recovery of the tokens.

This function showcases a graceful asset recovery solution, protecting user values even when message processing encounters issues.
