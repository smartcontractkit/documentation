Before starting the EVM to Aptos tutorials, ensure you have:

## Development Environment

- **Aptos CLI**: Install the Aptos CLI by following the official [installation guide](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli).

    <Aside type="caution" title="Update Aptos CLI">

  If you have an existing installation of the Aptos CLI, make sure to update it to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.

    </Aside>

- **Node.js v20 or higher**: You can use the [nvm package](http://nvm.sh/) to install and switch between Node.js versions. Once installed, verify the node version with:

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ node -v
  v22.15.0
  ```

- **Npm**: For installing and managing dependencies.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

## Starter Kit Repository

1.  Clone the CCIP Aptos Starter Kit:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/aptos-starter-kit.git
    ```

1.  Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd aptos-starter-kit
    ```

1.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Wallets

- **EVM Wallet and Private Key**: To send transactions from an EVM chain (like Ethereum Sepolia), you need a wallet and its private key.

  - Set up a wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
  - You will need to export the private key for the account you intend to send _from_. Follow the [official MetaMask guide](https://support.metamask.io/configure/accounts/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/) to obtain your private key and add it to the `.env` file as shown below.

- **Aptos Account**: You'll need an Aptos account. If you don't have one, create it with:

  ```bash
  aptos init --network testnet
  ```

  This command will guide you through creating a new account for Testnet and will save the credentials in a `.aptos/config.yaml` file. This also configures your Aptos CLI to use Testnet.

  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Aside type="note" title="Note">
    If you want to use your existing account from [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/), you can 
    [export your account's private key](https://petra.app/docs/use#find-account-phrase-and-keys),
    copy it, and use it in the following command:
    ```bash
    aptos init --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --network testnet
    ```
    <br></br>
    This command configures your Aptos CLI to use your existing account on Testnet and saves the credentials in a `.aptos/config.yaml` file.
  </Aside>

  Verify your current configuration with:

  ```bash
  aptos config show-profiles
  ```

  This should show your `default` profile configured for Testnet, with the `network` set to `Testnet`.

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ aptos config show-profiles

  {
    "Result": {
      "default": {
        "network": "Testnet",
        "has_private_key": true,
        "public_key": "ed25519-pub-0x2ecdd2d7bc0cbfe2e44c219ef9a9fddc986b384f4a01fb5d821cf0dab5d2fbae",
        "account": "d0e227835c33932721d54ae401cfaae753c295024fe454aa029b5e2782d2fad4",
        "rest_url": "https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Note down the `account` value from the output and **prepend `0x` to it**. You will need to use this value as one of the environment variables in your `.env` file, as shown below.

## Environment Configuration (`.env` file)

The starter kit uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information like private keys and RPC URLs. Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the `aptos-starter-kit` directory by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file and fill in the following values:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your source wallet (EOA) on Ethereum Sepolia from which you're sending CCIP-BnM tokens. You can export your private key from your MetaMask Wallet, as shown in the [Wallets](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/prerequisites#wallets) section above.
- `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: The RPC endpoint for the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. This is required to interact with the Ethereum Sepolia network. You can obtain an RPC URL by signing up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

**Example `.env` file:**

```
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY>
ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<RPC_URL_FOR_ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA>
```

## Native Tokens for Transaction Fees

**ETH** tokens are used for Ethereum Sepolia transaction fees. For these tutorials, we will also use **ETH** to pay for CCIP fees.

- You can use the [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucet.chain.link) to get test ETH.

## Obtaining Testnet Tokens

### LINK Tokens on EVM Chains

When using LINK tokens to pay for CCIP fees, you will need LINK tokens on Ethereum Sepolia. You can use the [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucet.chain.link) to get test LINK tokens.

### BnM Tokens on EVM Chains

To obtain CCIP-BnM tokens on Ethereum Sepolia, you can use the [Mint tokens in the documentation](/ccip/test-tokens#mint-tokens-in-the-documentation) section to get test BnM tokens.
