Before starting the EVM to Aptos tutorials, ensure you have:

## Development Environment

- **Aptos CLI**: Install the Aptos CLI by following the official [installation guide](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli).

    <Aside type="caution" title="Update Aptos CLI">

  If you have an existing installation of the Aptos CLI, make sure to update it to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.

    </Aside>

- **Node.js v20 or higher**: You can use the [nvm package](http://nvm.sh/) to install and switch between Node.js versions. Once installed, verify the node version with:

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ node -v
  v22.15.0
  ```

- **Npm**: For installing and managing dependencies.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

## Starter Kit Repository

1.  Clone the CCIP Aptos Starter Kit:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/aptos-starter-kit.git
    ```

1.  Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd aptos-starter-kit
    ```

1.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Understanding Named Addresses in the Manifest File (`Move.toml`)

The Move build system uses a manifest file, `Move.toml`, to define a package, its dependencies, and any named addresses it references. Named addresses are human-readable aliases for on-chain hexadecimal addresses, which makes the Move code cleaner, more readable, and easier to manage.

When you compile a Move package, the compiler replaces these aliases (e.g., `@ccip_router`) with their actual address values from the `Move.toml` file.

In the [`aptos-starter-kit`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/aptos-starter-kit), the example modules (like `ccip_message_sender`, `ccip_message_receiver`) need to interact with the core CCIP modules already deployed on the Aptos Testnet. The `[addresses]` section in their `Move.toml` files provides the necessary references.

**Example `Move.toml` Address Block:**

```toml
[addresses]
ccip = "0xc748085bd02022a9696dfa2058774f92a07401208bbd34cfd0c6d0ac0287ee45"
mcms = "0xbdf1b9aacb4e21bf6f255105831df0172e911d4748e488196fde10d2e2a4e32d"
mcms_register_entrypoints = "0x0"
ccip_onramp = "0xc748085bd02022a9696dfa2058774f92a07401208bbd34cfd0c6d0ac0287ee45"
ccip_router = "0xc748085bd02022a9696dfa2058774f92a07401208bbd34cfd0c6d0ac0287ee45"
```

Here is a breakdown of what each named address represents:

- **`ccip`**: This is the main **Object address** under which the core CCIP packages and their modules (like `fee_quoter`, `rmn_remote`, `token_admin_registry`, etc.) are published.

- **`ccip_router`** & **`ccip_onramp`**: These aliases also point to the main CCIP Object address. This is because the `router` and `onramp` modules are part of the packages published under that single, unified Object. The aliases are defined for clarity and consistency in the Move code's `use` statements.

- **`mcms`**: This is the address of the on-chain **ManyChainMultiSig (MCMS)** module, which is responsible for handling governance and administrative actions for the CCIP protocol through a secure, time-locked [implementation process](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/aptos/upgradability#implementation-process).

- **`mcms_register_entrypoints`**: This is a special value used as a **compile-time flag**. By setting it to `0x0`, the module is compiled in a way that bypasses the logic for registering with the MCMS system. This is useful for certain testing or deployment scenarios where the MCMS module is not relevant.

By defining these addresses in the `Move.toml` file, the example modules can interact with the core CCIP protocol without hardcoding long addresses, making the code portable and easier to update for different networks.

<Aside type="note" title="Mainnet Addresses">
  For the corresponding Aptos Mainnet addresses, refer to the [CCIP
  Directory](/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/aptos-mainnet).
</Aside>

## Wallets

- **EVM Wallet and Private Key**: To send transactions from an EVM chain (like Ethereum Sepolia), you need a wallet and its private key.
  - Set up a wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
  - You will need to export the private key for the account you intend to send _from_. Follow the [official MetaMask guide](https://support.metamask.io/configure/accounts/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/) to obtain your private key and add it to the `.env` file as shown below.

- **Aptos Account**: You'll need an Aptos account. If you don't have one, create it with:

  ```bash
  aptos init --network testnet
  ```

  This command will guide you through creating a new account for Testnet and will save the credentials in a `.aptos/config.yaml` file. This also configures your Aptos CLI to use Testnet.

  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Aside type="note" title="Note">
    If you want to use your existing account from [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/), you can 
    [export your account's private key](https://petra.app/docs/use#find-account-phrase-and-keys),
    copy it, and use it in the following command:
    ```bash
    aptos init --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --network testnet
    ```
    <br></br>
    This command configures your Aptos CLI to use your existing account on Testnet and saves the credentials in a `.aptos/config.yaml` file.
  </Aside>

  Verify your current configuration with:

  ```bash
  aptos config show-profiles
  ```

  This should show your `default` profile configured for Testnet, with the `network` set to `Testnet`.

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ aptos config show-profiles

  {
    "Result": {
      "default": {
        "network": "Testnet",
        "has_private_key": true,
        "public_key": "ed25519-pub-0x2ecdd2d7bc0cbfe2e44c219ef9a9fddc986b384f4a01fb5d821cf0dab5d2fbae",
        "account": "d0e227835c33932721d54ae401cfaae753c295024fe454aa029b5e2782d2fad4",
        "rest_url": "https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Note down the `account` value from the output and **prepend `0x` to it**. You will need to use this value as one of the environment variables in your `.env` file, as shown below.

## Environment Configuration (`.env` file)

The starter kit uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information like private keys and RPC URLs. Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the `aptos-starter-kit` directory by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file and fill in the following values:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your source wallet (EOA) on Ethereum Sepolia from which you're sending CCIP-BnM tokens. You can export your private key from your MetaMask Wallet, as shown in the [Wallets](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/prerequisites#wallets) section above.
- `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: The RPC endpoint for the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. This is required to interact with the Ethereum Sepolia network. You can obtain an RPC URL by signing up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

**Example `.env` file:**

```
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY>
ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<RPC_URL_FOR_ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA>
```

## Native Tokens for Transaction Fees

**ETH** tokens are used for Ethereum Sepolia transaction fees. For these tutorials, we will also use **ETH** to pay for CCIP fees.

- You can use the [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucet.chain.link) to get test ETH.

## Obtaining Testnet Tokens

### LINK Tokens on EVM Chains

When using LINK tokens to pay for CCIP fees, you will need LINK tokens on Ethereum Sepolia. You can use the [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucet.chain.link) to get test LINK tokens.

### BnM Tokens on EVM Chains

To obtain CCIP-BnM tokens on Ethereum Sepolia, you can use the [EVM Chains](/ccip/test-tokens#evm-chains) section to get test BnM tokens.
