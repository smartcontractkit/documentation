This tutorial demonstrates how to send a programmatic token transferâ€”a message containing both tokens and arbitrary dataâ€”from an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain to a Move module on the Aptos blockchain using Chainlink CCIP.

<Aside title="Prerequisites">
  Make sure you've completed the [prerequisites for EVM to Aptos
  tutorials](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/prerequisites) and understand how to [build CCIP messages from EVM to
  Aptos](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/build-messages) before beginning this tutorial.
</Aside>

## Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to send CCIP-BnM tokens from the Ethereum Sepolia testnet to a receiver module on the Aptos testnet. The message will also include a data payload containing a final recipient address. The receiver module will then execute logic to forward the received tokens to that final address.

## What You will Build

In this tutorial, you will:

- Publish a CCIP receiver module to the Aptos Testnet.
- Configure a CCIP message containing both a token transfer and a data payload.
- Send the message from Ethereum Sepolia to your Aptos module.
- Pay for CCIP transaction fees using LINK or native ETH.
- Verify that the receiver module executed its logic and forwarded the tokens to the final destination.

## Understanding Programmatic Token Transfers

A programmatic token transfer combines the features of a token transfer and an arbitrary message. It allows you to send assets and instructions in a single, atomic cross-chain transaction.

- **Module Execution**: The message and tokens are sent to a specific module on Aptos, triggering the execution of its `ccip_receive` function.
- **Combined Payload**:
  - The `receiver` is the address of your custom Aptos module.
  - The `tokenAmounts` array is populated with the tokens to transfer.
  - The `data` field contains the instructions for the module.
- The `extraArgs` field should be encoded with a `gasLimit` and a `allowOutOfOrderExecution` flag.
  - The `gasLimit` must be a tested value and sufficient for the execution of the `ccip_receive` function of the receiver module (i.e., the destination Aptos module). This includes performing a token transfer in this case, but may also include other logic depending on the module's implementation and the exact use case.
  - The `allowOutOfOrderExecution` flag must be set to `true` when Aptos is the destination chain.

### The `ccip_message_receiver` Module

This tutorial uses the `ccip_message_receiver` module from the `aptos-starter-kit`. Its `ccip_receive` function contains dispatcher logic. For this tutorial, we will trigger the part of its logic that handles a message containing both tokens and data.

- **Logic**: When the module receives both tokens and data, it interprets the `data` payload as the 32-byte address of a final recipient. It then uses its on-chain `signer` capability (derived from being deployed on a Resource Account) to transfer the tokens it just received to that final recipient address. Finally, it emits a `ForwardedTokens` event.

<Aside title="Scope Clarification">
  This guide focuses on sending messages to an existing, pre-written module. To learn how to write your own receiver
  from scratch, please refer to the **[Implementing CCIP Receivers on Aptos](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/receivers)** guide.
</Aside>

## Implementing the Programmatic Transfer

### Publish the Receiver Module

<Aside type="note">
  If you have already published the `ccip_message_receiver` module while following the [Arbitrary Messaging
  Tutorial](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/arbitrary-messaging), you can reuse the same module address for this
  tutorial and skip this deployment step.
</Aside>

First, the destination module must be deployed on the Aptos Testnet. Because this module will handle and transfer tokens, it must be deployed to a **Resource Account**.

Run the following command from the starter kit:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/deploy/aptos/createResourceAccountAndPublishReceiver.ts
```

**Copy the address** of the new resource account from the output. This is your receiver module's address.

### Configure and Send the Message

The `evm2aptos/ccipTokenForwarder.ts` script handles the configuration and sending of the message. The core of the script builds the message payload:

```typescript
// From scripts/evm2aptos/ccipTokenForwarder.ts
const ccipMessage = buildCCIPMessage(
  recipient, // The address of your deployed Aptos receiver module
  aptosAccountAddress, // The final recipient's Aptos address, sent as data
  tokenAddress, // The address of the CCIP-BnM token on Sepolia
  tokenAmount, // The amount of tokens to send
  feeTokenAddress, // The address of the fee token (e.g., LINK)
  encodeExtraArgsV2(100000n, true) // A gasLimit for the receiver's logic
)
```

## Running the Script

### Execute the Script

Run the script from your terminal. You will need to provide three key arguments:

- `--aptosReceiver`: The address of the module you just deployed.
- `--aptosAccount`: The final destination address where the tokens should be forwarded.
- `--amount`: The number of tokens to send.

This example sends from **Ethereum Sepolia** and pays fees in LINK:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/evm2aptos/ccipTokenForwarder.ts --sourceChain sepolia --feeToken link --amount 0.001 --aptosReceiver <YOUR_RECEIVER_MODULE_ADDRESS> --aptosAccount <FINAL_RECIPIENT_APTOS_ADDRESS>
```

### Expected Output

The script will output the progress of the transaction and finish by providing the transaction hash and the CCIP Message ID.

```text
Base Fee (in LINK JUELS): ...
Fee with 20% buffer (in LINK JUELS): ...
Current Allowance of CCIP-BnM token: 0
Approval tx sent: 0x...
Approval transaction confirmed in block 8803748 after 3 confirmations.
Router contract approved to spend 1000000000000000 of CCIP-BnM token from your account.
Current Allowance of LINK token: 0
Approval tx sent: 0x...
Approval transaction confirmed in block ... after 3 confirmations.
Router contract approved to spend ... of LINK token from your account.
Proceeding with the token transfer...
Transaction sent: 0x...
Waiting for transaction confirmation...
Transaction confirmed in block 8803754 after 3 confirmations.
âœ… Transaction successful: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x...
ðŸ†” CCIP Message ID: 0x...
ðŸ”— CCIP Explorer URL: https://ccip.chain.link/#/side-drawer/msg/0x...
```

## Verification

Verification is a multi-step process: you must confirm the message was executed and then confirm that your module's logic produced the correct outcome.

### Check Message Execution

#### Use the CCIP Explorer to check the message status

Use the CCIP Explorer link provided in the transaction output to track your message status across chains. The explorer gives an overview of the entire cross-chain transaction life cycle.

```text
ðŸ”— CCIP Explorer URL: https://ccip.chain.link/#/side-drawer/msg/<YOUR_CCIP_MESSAGE_ID>
```

#### Programmatically check the message status

After you receive a CCIP Message ID, you can programmatically check if the CCIP message has been successfully executed on the Aptos network. This is done by querying the [`ExecutionStateChanged`](/ccip/api-reference/aptos/v1.6.0/events#execute_single_report) event emitted by the CCIP OffRamp module. The `evm2aptos/checkMsgExecutionStateOnAptos.ts` script is designed for this purpose.

After 15-20 minutes, run the script using the CCIP Message ID you received from the previous step.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  Since end-to-end transaction time depends primarily on the time to finality on the source blockchain (Ethereum Sepolia
  in this case), it's recommended to wait 15-20 minutes before running the script. For more details, refer to the
  [Finality by Blockchain](/ccip/ccip-execution-latency#finality-by-blockchain).
</Aside>

**Command**:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/evm2aptos/checkMsgExecutionStateOnAptos.ts --msgId <YOUR_CCIP_MESSAGE_ID>
```

_Replace `<YOUR_CCIP_MESSAGE_ID>` with the actual CCIP Message ID from the log output._

**Output**:
When the message has been successfully delivered, you will see the following output:

```text
Execution state for CCIP message <YOUR_CCIP_MESSAGE_ID> is SUCCESS
```

### Verify the Outcome

Once execution is successful, you need to verify that your module correctly forwarded the tokens.

- **Check the Event**: You can manually verify that your module emitted the correct `ForwardedTokens` event by using the [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/?network=testnet).
  1.  Search for your receiver module's address (the one you provided with `--aptosReceiver`).
  1.  In the `Transactions` tab, find the latest transaction that calls the `offramp::execute` function.
  1.  Click on the transaction and navigate to the `Events` tab.
  1.  You should find an event with the following structure, confirming that your module's logic was executed:

      ```text
      Account Address: <YOUR_RECEIVER_MODULE_ADDRESS>
      Creation Number: 3
      Sequence Number: 0
      Type: <YOUR_RECEIVER_MODULE_ADDRESS>::ccip_message_receiver::ForwardedTokens
      Data: {
      final_recipient: "<FINAL_RECIPIENT_APTOS_ADDRESS>"
      }
      ```

- **Check the Final Balance**: The ultimate verification is checking the token balance of the final recipient. Search for the address you provided in the `--aptosAccount` argument on the Aptos Explorer. Under the "Tokens" tab, you should see the new balance of the CCIP-BnM token.
