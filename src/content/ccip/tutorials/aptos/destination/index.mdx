This section provides comprehensive guides and tutorials for implementing cross-chain communication from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains to Aptos chains using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).

## Getting Started

Before implementing specific use cases, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts and message structure for EVM to Aptos communication:

- [Building CCIP Messages from EVM to Aptos](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/build-messages) - Learn the core message structure, required parameters, and implementation details for all message types.
- [Prerequisites for EVM to Aptos Tutorials](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/prerequisites) - Set up your development environment with Aptos CLI tools, wallets, and token accounts.

## Tutorials by Use Case

Depending on your specific needs, choose the appropriate tutorial:

- [Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/token-transfers) - Send tokens from EVM chains to Aptos wallets without program execution.
- [Arbitrary Messaging](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/arbitrary-messaging) - Send data from EVM chains to Aptos module.
- [Programmable Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/destination/programmable-token-transfers) - Send both tokens and data in a single message to trigger module execution with token transfers.
