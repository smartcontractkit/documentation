Before starting the Aptos to EVM tutorials, ensure you have:

## Development Environment

- **Aptos CLI**: Install the Aptos CLI by following the official [installation guide](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli).

    <Aside type="caution" title="Update Aptos CLI">

  If you have an existing installation of the Aptos CLI, make sure to update it to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.

    </Aside>

- **Node.js v20 or higher**: You can use the [nvm package](http://nvm.sh/) to install and switch between Node.js versions. Once installed, verify the node version with:

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ node -v
  v22.15.0
  ```

- **Npm**: For installing and managing dependencies.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

## Starter Kit Repository

1.  Clone the CCIP Aptos Starter Kit:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/aptos-starter-kit.git
    ```

1.  Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd aptos-starter-kit
    ```

1.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Understanding Named Addresses in the Manifest File (`Move.toml`)

The Move build system uses a manifest file, `Move.toml`, to define a package, its dependencies, and any named addresses it references. Named addresses are human-readable aliases for on-chain hexadecimal addresses, which makes the Move code cleaner, more readable, and easier to manage.

When you compile a Move package, the compiler replaces these aliases (e.g., `@ccip_router`) with their actual address values from the `Move.toml` file.

In the [`aptos-starter-kit`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/aptos-starter-kit), the example modules (like `ccip_message_sender`, `ccip_message_receiver`) need to interact with the core CCIP modules already deployed on the Aptos Testnet. The `[addresses]` section in their `Move.toml` files provides the necessary references.

**Example `Move.toml` Address Block:**

```toml
[addresses]
ccip = "0xc748085bd02022a9696dfa2058774f92a07401208bbd34cfd0c6d0ac0287ee45"
mcms = "0xbdf1b9aacb4e21bf6f255105831df0172e911d4748e488196fde10d2e2a4e32d"
mcms_register_entrypoints = "0x0"
ccip_onramp = "0xc748085bd02022a9696dfa2058774f92a07401208bbd34cfd0c6d0ac0287ee45"
ccip_router = "0xc748085bd02022a9696dfa2058774f92a07401208bbd34cfd0c6d0ac0287ee45"
```

Here is a breakdown of what each named address represents:

- **`ccip`**: This is the main **Object address** under which the core CCIP packages and their modules (like `fee_quoter`, `rmn_remote`, `token_admin_registry`, etc.) are published.

- **`ccip_router`** & **`ccip_onramp`**: These aliases also point to the main CCIP Object address. This is because the `router` and `onramp` modules are part of the packages published under that single, unified Object. The aliases are defined for clarity and consistency in the Move code's `use` statements.

- **`mcms`**: This is the address of the on-chain **ManyChainMultiSig (MCMS)** module, which is responsible for handling governance and administrative actions for the CCIP protocol through a secure, time-locked [implementation process](/ccip/concepts/architecture/onchain/aptos/upgradability#implementation-process).

- **`mcms_register_entrypoints`**: This is a special value used as a **compile-time flag**. By setting it to `0x0`, the module is compiled in a way that bypasses the logic for registering with the MCMS system. This is useful for certain testing or deployment scenarios where the MCMS module is not relevant.

By defining these addresses in the `Move.toml` file, the example modules can interact with the core CCIP protocol without hardcoding long addresses, making the code portable and easier to update for different networks.

<Aside type="note" title="Mainnet Addresses">
  For the corresponding Aptos Mainnet addresses, refer to the [CCIP
  Directory](/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/aptos-mainnet).
</Aside>

## Wallets

- **Aptos Account**: You'll need an Aptos account. If you don't have one, create it with:

  ```bash
  aptos init --network testnet
  ```

  This command will guide you through creating a new account for Testnet and will save the credentials in a `.aptos/config.yaml` file. This also configures your Aptos CLI to use Testnet.

  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Aside type="note" title="Note">
    If you want to use your existing account from [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/), you can 
    [export your account's private key](https://petra.app/docs/use#find-account-phrase-and-keys),
    copy it, and use it in the following command:
    ```bash
    aptos init --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --network testnet
    ```
    <br></br>
    This command configures your Aptos CLI to use your existing account on Testnet and saves the credentials in a `.aptos/config.yaml` file.
  </Aside>

  Verify your current configuration with:

  ```bash
  aptos config show-profiles
  ```

  This should show your `default` profile configured for Testnet, with the `network` set to `Testnet`.

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ aptos config show-profiles

  {
    "Result": {
      "default": {
        "network": "Testnet",
        "has_private_key": true,
        "public_key": "ed25519-pub-0x2ecdd2d7bc0cbfe2e44c219ef9a9fddc986b384f4a01fb5d821cf0dab5d2fbae",
        "account": "d0e227835c33932721d54ae401cfaae753c295024fe454aa029b5e2782d2fad4",
        "rest_url": "https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **EVM Wallet Address**: You'll need an EVM-compatible wallet address to receive tokens on the destination chain (Ethereum Sepolia). You only need the address itself, not the private key, as you are only sending _to_ this address.

## Environment Configuration (`.env` file)

The starter kit uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information like private keys and RPC URLs. Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the `aptos-starter-kit` directory by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file and fill in the following values:

- `PRIVATE_KEY_HEX`: The private key of your source wallet (EOA) on Aptos Testnet from which you're sending CCIP-BnM tokens. You can find this in the `.aptos/config.yaml` file created by the `aptos init --network testnet` command, as shown in the [Wallets](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/prerequisites#wallets) section above.
- `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: The RPC endpoint for the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. This is required by the verification script (`aptos2evm/checkMsgExecutionStateOnAptos.ts`) to read the `ExecutionStateChanged` event from the CCIP OffRamp on Ethereum Sepolia. You can obtain an RPC URL by signing up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

**Example `.env` file:**

```
PRIVATE_KEY_HEX=<YOUR_APTOS_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX>
ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<RPC_URL_FOR_ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA>
```

## Native Tokens for Transaction Fees

**APT** tokens are used for Aptos transaction fees. For these tutorials, we will also use **APT** to pay for CCIP fees.

- Obtain **APT** on Testnet using the faucet:

  You can use the official [Aptos Testnet Faucet](https://aptos.dev/en/network/faucet) to get **APT** tokens. Simply enter your Aptos account address and click on **Mint** to request tokens.

- Check your account balance:

  ```bash
  aptos account balance
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ aptos account balance

  {
    "Result": [
      {
        "asset_type": "coin",
        "coin_type": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
        "balance": 100000000
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Obtaining Testnet Tokens

### BnM Tokens on Aptos

To complete the cross-chain token transfer examples, you'll need BnM tokens. To obtain CCIP-BnM tokens on Aptos Testnet, run the `faucets/aptos/dripCCIPBnMToken.ts` script included in the starter kit.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/faucets/aptos/dripCCIPBnMToken.ts --to <YOUR_APTOS_WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
Replace `<YOUR_APTOS_WALLET_ADDRESS>` with your actual Aptos wallet address (the `account` value from the output of the `aptos config show-profiles` command, as shown in the [Wallets](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/prerequisites#wallets) section above).
</Aside>

The output looks like this:

```text
1 CCIP-BnM token is minted to 0xd0e227835c33932721d54ae401cfaae753c295024fe454aa029b5e2782d2fad4 successfully.
