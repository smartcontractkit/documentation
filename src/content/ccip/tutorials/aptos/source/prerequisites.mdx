Before starting the Aptos to EVM tutorials, ensure you have:

## Development Environment

- **Aptos CLI**: Install the Aptos CLI by following the official [installation guide](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli).

    <Aside type="caution" title="Update Aptos CLI">

  If you have an existing installation of the Aptos CLI, make sure to update it to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.

    </Aside>

- **Node.js v20 or higher**: You can use the [nvm package](http://nvm.sh/) to install and switch between Node.js versions. Once installed, verify the node version with:

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ node -v
  v22.15.0
  ```

- **Npm**: For installing and managing dependencies.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

## Starter Kit Repository

1.  Clone the CCIP Aptos Starter Kit:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/aptos-starter-kit.git
    ```

1.  Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd aptos-starter-kit
    ```

1.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Wallets

- **Aptos Account**: You'll need an Aptos account. If you don't have one, create it with:

  ```bash
  aptos init --network testnet
  ```

  This command will guide you through creating a new account for Testnet and will save the credentials in a `.aptos/config.yaml` file. This also configures your Aptos CLI to use Testnet.

  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Aside type="note" title="Note">
    If you want to use your existing account from [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/), you can 
    [export your account's private key](https://petra.app/docs/use#find-account-phrase-and-keys),
    copy it, and use it in the following command:
    ```bash
    aptos init --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --network testnet
    ```
    <br></br>
    This command configures your Aptos CLI to use your existing account on Testnet and saves the credentials in a `.aptos/config.yaml` file.
  </Aside>

  Verify your current configuration with:

  ```bash
  aptos config show-profiles
  ```

  This should show your `default` profile configured for Testnet, with the `network` set to `Testnet`.

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ aptos config show-profiles

  {
    "Result": {
      "default": {
        "network": "Testnet",
        "has_private_key": true,
        "public_key": "ed25519-pub-0x2ecdd2d7bc0cbfe2e44c219ef9a9fddc986b384f4a01fb5d821cf0dab5d2fbae",
        "account": "d0e227835c33932721d54ae401cfaae753c295024fe454aa029b5e2782d2fad4",
        "rest_url": "https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **EVM Wallet Address**: You'll need an EVM-compatible wallet address to receive tokens on the destination chain (Ethereum Sepolia). You only need the address itself, not the private key, as you are only sending _to_ this address.

## Environment Configuration (`.env` file)

The starter kit uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information like private keys and RPC URLs. Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the `aptos-starter-kit` directory by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file and fill in the following values:

- `PRIVATE_KEY_HEX`: The private key of your source wallet (EOA) on Aptos Testnet from which you're sending CCIP-BnM tokens. You can find this in the `.aptos/config.yaml` file created by the `aptos init --network testnet` command, as shown in the [Wallets](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/prerequisites#wallets) section above.
- `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: The RPC endpoint for the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. This is required by the verification script (`aptos2evm/checkMsgExecutionStateOnAptos.ts`) to read the `ExecutionStateChanged` event from the CCIP OffRamp on Ethereum Sepolia. You can obtain an RPC URL by signing up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

**Example `.env` file:**

```
PRIVATE_KEY_HEX=<YOUR_APTOS_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX>
ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<RPC_URL_FOR_ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA>
```

## Native Tokens for Transaction Fees

**APT** tokens are used for Aptos transaction fees. For these tutorials, we will also use **APT** to pay for CCIP fees.

- Obtain **APT** on Testnet using the faucet:

  You can use the official [Aptos Testnet Faucet](https://aptos.dev/en/network/faucet) to get **APT** tokens. Simply enter your Aptos account address and click on **Mint** to request tokens.

- Check your account balance:

  ```bash
  aptos account balance
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text
  $ aptos account balance

  {
    "Result": [
      {
        "asset_type": "coin",
        "coin_type": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
        "balance": 100000000
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Obtaining Testnet Tokens

### BnM Tokens on Aptos

To complete the cross-chain token transfer examples, you'll need BnM tokens. To obtain CCIP-BnM tokens on Aptos Testnet, run the `faucets/aptos/dripCCIPBnMToken.ts` script included in the starter kit.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/faucets/aptos/dripCCIPBnMToken.ts --to <YOUR_APTOS_WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
Replace `<YOUR_APTOS_WALLET_ADDRESS>` with your actual Aptos wallet address (the `account` value from the output of the `aptos config show-profiles` command, as shown in the [Wallets](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/prerequisites#wallets) section above).
</Aside>

The output looks like this:

```text
1 CCIP-BnM token is minted to 0xd0e227835c33932721d54ae401cfaae753c295024fe454aa029b5e2782d2fad4 successfully.

```
