This section provides comprehensive guides and tutorials for implementing cross-chain communication from Aptos chains to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).

## Getting Started

Before implementing specific use cases, it's important to set up your environment and understand the fundamental concepts:

- [Building CCIP Messages from Aptos to EVM](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/build-messages) - Learn the core message structure, required parameters, and implementation details for all message types.
- [Prerequisites for Aptos to EVM Tutorials](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/prerequisites) - Set up your development environment with Aptos CLI tools, wallets, and token accounts.

## Tutorials by Use Case

Depending on your specific needs, choose the appropriate tutorial:

- [Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/aptos/source/token-transfers) - Send tokens from Aptos to EVM chains without executing code on the destination.
