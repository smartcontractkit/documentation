## Introduction

This guide explains how to construct CCIP Messages from SVM chains (e.g. Solana) to EVM chains (e.g. Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, etc.). We'll cover the message structure, required parameters, account management, and implementation details for different message types including token transfers, arbitrary data messaging, and programmatic token transfers (data and tokens).

## CCIP Message Structure

CCIP messages from SVM are built using the [`SVM2AnyMessage` struct](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-ccip/blob/contracts-ccip-release/1.6.0/chains/solana/contracts/programs/ccip-router/src/messages.rs#L51) from the CCIP Router program. The `SVM2AnyMessage` struct is defined as follows:

```rust
pub struct SVM2AnyMessage {
    pub receiver: Vec<u8>,
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
    pub token_amounts: Vec<SVMTokenAmount>,
    pub fee_token: Pubkey, // pass zero address if native SOL
    pub extra_args: Vec<u8>,
}
```

### receiver

- For EVM destinations:
  - This is the hex-encoded address of the contract or wallet that will receive the message
  - Must be properly formatted as a 20-byte Ethereum address
  - Can target smart contracts that implement `ccipReceive` function or user wallets for token-only transfers

<Aside type="caution" title="Receiver Format">
  When providing an EVM address as the receiver, it must be properly encoded as a byte array without the '0x' prefix.
</Aside>

### data

- Contains the payload that will be passed to the receiving contract on the destination chain
- For token-only transfers: Must be empty
- For arbitrary messaging or programmatic token transfers: Contains the data the receiver contract will process
- Encoding consideration: The receiver on the destination chain must be able to correctly decode this data.

### tokenAmounts

- An array of token addresses and amounts to transfer
- Each token is represented by a `SVMTokenAmount` struct that contains:
  - `token`: The Solana token mint public key
  - `amount`: The amount to transfer in the token's native denomination
- For data-only messages: Must be an empty array
- **Note**: Check the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) for the list of supported tokens on each lane

### feeToken

- Specifies which token to use for paying CCIP fees
- Use `Pubkey::default()` to pay fees with native SOL
- Alternatively, specify a token mint address for fee payment with that token
- **Note**: Check the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) for the list of supported fees tokens for the SVM chain you are using

### extraArgs

For EVM-bound messages, the `extraArgs` field must include properly encoded parameters for:

```rust
struct GenericExtraArgsV2 {
    gas_limit: u256,
    allow_out_of_order_execution: bool,
}
```

- `gas_limit`: Specifies the amount of gas allocated for calling the receiving contract on the destination chain
- `allow_out_of_order_execution`: Flag that determines if messages can be executed out of order

<Aside title="Setting Extra Args">

- Gas limit:
  - For token transfers only: Gas limit must be set to 0
  - For arbitrary messaging or programmatic token transfers: gas limit must be set based on the receiving contract's complexity.
- Allow out of order execution:
  - Must always be set to true.

</Aside>

## Implementation by Message Type

### Token Transfer

Use this configuration when sending only tokens from SVM to EVM chains:

    ```typescript
    const message = {
      receiver: evmReceiverAddressBytes, // 20-byte EVM address as byte array
      data: new Uint8Array(), // Empty data for token-only transfer
      tokenAmounts: [{ token: tokenMint, amount: amount }],
      feeToken: feeTokenMint, // Or Pubkey.default() for native SOL
      extraArgs: encodeExtraArgs({
        gasLimit: 0, // Must be 0 for token-only transfers
        allowOutOfOrderExecution: true // Must be true for all messages
      })
    };
    ```

<Aside type="note" title="Key Requirements">

- `gasLimit` **MUST** be 0 for token-only transfers
- `data` must be empty
- The receiver must be properly formatted as a 20-byte Ethereum address
- `allowOutOfOrderExecution` must be true for all messages
- Check the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) for the list of supported tokens for the lane you are using

</Aside>

### Arbitrary Messaging

Use this configuration when sending only data to EVM chains:

    ```typescript
    const message = {
      receiver: evmReceiverAddressBytes, // 20-byte EVM address as byte array
      data: messageData, // Encoded data to send
      tokenAmounts: [], // Empty array for data-only messages
      feeToken: feeTokenMint, // Or Pubkey.default() for native SOL
      extraArgs: encodeExtraArgs({
        gasLimit: 200000, // Appropriate gas limit for the receiving contract
        allowOutOfOrderExecution: true // Must be true for all messages
      })
    };
    ```

<Aside type="note" title="Key Requirements">

- `gasLimit` must be sufficient for the receiving contract to process the message
- `data` must be properly encoded to be compatible with the receiving contract
- `tokenAmounts` must be an empty array
- `allowOutOfOrderExecution` must be true for all messages
- The receiver must be a contract that implements `ccipReceive` function

</Aside>

### Programmatic Token Transfer (Data and Tokens)

Use this configuration when sending both tokens and data in a single message:

    ```typescript
    const message = {
      receiver: evmReceiverAddressBytes, // 20-byte EVM address as byte array
      data: messageData, // Encoded data to send
      tokenAmounts: [{ token: tokenMint, amount: amount }],
      feeToken: feeTokenMint, // Or Pubkey.default() for native SOL
      extraArgs: encodeExtraArgs({
        gasLimit: 300000, // Higher gas limit for complex operations
        allowOutOfOrderExecution: true // Must be true for all messages
      })
    };
    ```

<Aside type="note" title="Key Requirements">

- `gasLimit` must be sufficient for the receiving contract to process the message
- `data` must be properly encoded to be compatible with the receiving contract
- `tokenAmounts` must be an array of tokens to transfer
- The receiving contract must implement logic to handle both tokens and data
- `allowOutOfOrderExecution` must be true for all messages
- Check the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) for the list of supported tokens for the lane you are using

</Aside>

## Understanding the `ccip_send` Instruction

The core of sending CCIP messages from SVM is the `ccip_send` instruction in the CCIP Router program. This instruction requires several key components to be prepared correctly:

### Core Components for `ccip_send`

1. **Destination Chain Selector**: A unique identifier for the target blockchain
1. **Message Structure**: The `SVM2AnyMessage` containing receiver, data, tokens, etc.
1. **Required Accounts**: All accounts needed for the instruction
1. **Token Indices**: For token transfers, indices marking where each token's accounts begin

### Data Encoding for Cross-Chain Compatibility

When sending data from SVM to EVM chains, proper encoding is crucial:

<Tabs client:visible>

<Fragment slot="tab.1">Encoding Data for EVM Chains</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="tab.2">Example: String Encoding for EVM Receivers</Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">

    When sending messages across chains:

    - Ensure the data payload uses an encoding format that's compatible with the receiver contract on the destination chain.
    - For EVM-based destinations, implement Ethereum ABI encoding to guarantee proper data interpretation upon receipt.

  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.2">

    ```typescript
    // Example: Encoding a string message for an EVM receiver
    // Import ethers ABI coder
    import {ethers} from 'ethers';

    // Create an ABI coder instance
    const abiCoder = new ethers.utils.AbiCoder();

    // Encode a string message
    // Note: abiCoder.encode returns a hex string with '0x' prefix
    const encodedHex = abiCoder.encode(['string'], ['Hello from SVM ']);

    // Remove '0x' prefix and convert to byte array for Solana
    const messageData = Buffer.from(encodedHex.slice(2), 'hex');
    ```

  </Fragment>
  
</Tabs>

### Account Requirements

Unlike EVM chains which use a simple mapping storage model, SVM account model requires explicit specification of all accounts needed for an operation. When sending CCIP messages, several account types are needed:

<Tabs client:visible>

<Fragment slot="tab.1">Core Accounts</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="tab.2">Token Transfer Accounts</Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">

    1. Core Accounts
        1. Config PDA (index 0): The CCIP Router configuration account - Stores router configuration settings.
        1. Destination Chain (index 1): State account for the target chain - Stores information about the destination chain and is writable because it's updated during message sending.
        1. Nonce (index 2): Per-user sequence tracking - Keeps track of message sequence numbers for each user and destination chain pair, and is writable because it's incremented with each message.
        1. Authority (signer) (index 3): Transaction signer/fee payer - The account that signs the transaction and pays for fees, must be a signer and is writable.
        1. System Program (index 4): For account creation if needed - Required for account creation operations.

    1. Fee Payment Accounts
        1. Fee Token Program (index 5): Token program for the fee token - Either the standard SPL Token or Token-2022 program.

    1. Fee Quoter Accounts
        1. Fee Quoter (index 10): The Fee Quoter program account - Program responsible for calculating fees.
        1. Fee Quoter Config (index 11): Configuration account for the Fee Quoter - Stores global configuration for the Fee Quoter.
        1. Fee Quoter Dest Chain (index 12): Destination chain configuration for the Fee Quoter - Specific fee configuration for the target chain.
        1. Fee Quoter Billing Token Config (index 13): Fee token configuration for billing - Specific configuration for the token used to pay fees.
        1. Fee Quoter Link Token Config (index 14): LINK token configuration for the Fee Quoter - Configuration for LINK token as a reference.

    1. RMN Remote Accounts
        1. RMN Remote (index 15): The Remote Monitoring Network program - Responsible for cross-chain monitoring and validation.
        1. RMN Remote Curses (index 16): Curse records for the Remote Monitoring Network - Stores validation information.
        1. RMN Remote Config (index 17): Configuration for the Remote Monitoring Network - Stores settings for the RMN program.

    These accounts must be provided in precisely this order.

  </Fragment>
  
  <Fragment slot="panel.2">

    For each token being transferred, the following accounts must be provided:

    1. User Token Account (writable) - Source of tokens
    1. CCIP Pool Chain Config (writable) - Chain configuration PDA
    1. Token Pool Lookup Table - Address Lookup Table for the token

    1. Token Mint - The token's mint
    1. CCIP Router Pools Signer - Router's signer for the pool

    These accounts must be provided in exactly this order in the `remaining_accounts` parameter.

    **Note**: The `tokenIndexes` parameter must be provided in the `ccip_send` instruction parameter, containing the starting indices in the remaining accounts array where each token's accounts begin.

  </Fragment>

</Tabs>

<Aside  title="Account Derivation">

These accounts are Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) that must be derived with specific seeds:

**Core Router PDAs:**

- Config: `["config"]` - Derived from CCIP Router program
- Destination Chain: `["dest_chain_state", destChainSelector]` - Derived from CCIP Router program
- Nonce: `["nonce", destChainSelector, userPubkey]` - Derived from CCIP Router program
- Fee Billing Signer: `["fee_billing_signer"]` - Derived from CCIP Router program

**Fee Quoter PDAs:**

- Fee Quoter Config: `["config"]` - Derived from Fee Quoter program
- Fee Quoter Dest Chain: `["dest_chain", destChainSelector]` - Derived from Fee Quoter program
- Fee Quoter Billing Token Config: `["billing_token_config", tokenMint]` - Derived from Fee Quoter program
- Fee Quoter Link Token Config: `["billing_token_config", linkTokenMint]` - Derived from Fee Quoter program

**RMN Remote PDAs:**

- RMN Remote Curses: `["curses"]` - Derived from RMN Remote program
- RMN Remote Config: `["config"]` - Derived from RMN Remote program

**Token-specific PDAs:**

- Token Admin Registry: `["token_admin_registry", tokenMint]` - Derived from CCIP Router program
- Pool Chain Config: `["pool_chain_config", destChainSelector, tokenMint]` - Derived from Pool program
- Pool Signer: `["pool_signer"]` - Derived from Pool program
- CCIP Router Pools Signer: `["external_token_pools_signer", poolProgram]` - Derived from CCIP Router program

Using incorrect seeds or deriving PDAs from the wrong program will result in account validation failures. All PDAs must be properly derived based on their respective program IDs.

</Aside>

### ExtraArgs Encoding for EVM Destinations

For EVM destinations, you must encode the `extraArgs` field with gas limit and execution flag:

1. Create a tag for GenericExtraArgsV2 `0x181dcf10`
1. Serialize the `gasLimit` as a 32-byte big-endian number
1. Add a flags byte for execution order (`0x00` for strict order, `0x01` for allowing out of order). **Note**: Must be `0x01` (allowing out of order) for all messages.
1. Concatenate the tag, gas limit bytes, and flags byte

```typescript
// Structure of extraArgs for EVM destinations:
{
  gasLimit: number,              // Gas limit for execution on the destination chain
  allowOutOfOrderExecution: bool // Whether messages can be executed out of order
}

// Example:
const TAG_EVM_EXTRA_ARGS_V2 = Buffer.from([0x18, 0x1d, 0xcf, 0x10]); // 0x181dcf10
const gasLimitBuffer = Buffer.from(new BN(200000).toArray("be", 32));
const flagsByte = allowOutOfOrderExecution ? Buffer.from([1]) : Buffer.from([0]);
const extraArgs = Buffer.concat([TAG_EVM_EXTRA_ARGS_V2, gasLimitBuffer, flagsByte]);
```

## Handling Transaction Size Limits

SVM chains have transaction size limitations that become important when sending CCIP messages:

1.  **Account Reference Limit:**

    - SVM transactions have a limit on how many accounts they can reference
    - Each token transfer adds approximately 11-12 accounts to your transaction

1.  **Address Lookup Tables (ALTs):**

    - ALTs allow transactions to reference accounts without including full public keys
    - The CCIP Router requires each token to have an ALT in its Token Admin Registry
    - The CCIP Router relies on these ALTs to locate the correct Pool Program and other token-specific accounts

     <Aside title="Address Lookup Tables (ALTs) in CCIP">

        Address Lookup Tables are a critical architectural component of CCIP token transfers from SVM:

            - Each supported token requires a registered ALT in its Token Admin Registry
            - ALTs contain essential token-specific accounts including the Pool Program
            - The Router program uses ALTs to locate required accounts for token transfers
            - Token transfers will fail without properly configured ALTs
            - When implementing transfers, ensure your transaction includes the ALT for each token

     </Aside>

1.  **Transaction Serialized Size:**

    - Even with ALTs, SVM transactions have a maximum serialized size (1232 bytes)
    - Each token transfer increases the transaction size
    - If your transaction exceeds this limit, you'll need to split it into multiple transactions

## Tracking Messages with Transaction Logs

After sending a CCIP message, the CCIP Router emits a `CCIPMessageSent` event in the transaction logs containing key tracking information:

```
Program log: Event: {
  "name": "CCIPMessageSent",
  "data": {
    "dest_chain_selector": [destination chain ID],
    "sequence_number": [sequence number],
    "message": {
      "header": {
        "message_id": "0x123...",
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `message_id` in the event header serves as the unique cross-chain identifier that:

- Links transactions between source and destination chains
- Provides confirmation of successful message execution

Store this identifier in your application for transaction tracking and reconciliation.
