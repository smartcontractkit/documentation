This section provides comprehensive guides and tutorials for implementing cross-chain communication from Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chains to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).

## Getting Started

Before implementing specific use cases, it's important to set up your environment and understand the fundamental concepts:

- [Building CCIP Messages from SVM to EVM](/ccip/tutorials/svm/source/build-messages) - Learn the core message structure, required parameters, and implementation details for all message types
- [Prerequisites for SVM to EVM Tutorials](/ccip/tutorials/svm/source/prerequisites) - Set up your development environment with Solana CLI tools, wallets, token accounts, and delegations

## Tutorials by Use Case

Depending on your specific needs, choose the appropriate tutorial:

- [Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/svm/source/token-transfers) - Send tokens from Solana to EVM chains without executing code on the destination
