Chainlink CCIP enables secure cross-chain communication between Solana and EVM blockchains. These tutorials will help you implement cross-chain functionality in both directions.

## Getting Started

Before diving into specific implementations, ensure you understand the fundamentals:

- [Prerequisites for SVM to EVM Tutorials](/ccip/tutorials/svm/source/prerequisites) - Set up your development environment for Solana-based CCIP development
- [Implementing CCIP Receivers](/ccip/tutorials/svm/receivers) - Learn how to build secure Solana programs that can receive cross-chain messages

## Using Solana as a Source Chain

Send messages and tokens from Solana to EVM chains:

- [SVM to EVM Guide](/ccip/tutorials/svm/source) - Comprehensive guide for building all types of CCIP messages from Solana to EVM chains
- [Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/svm/source/token-transfers) - Transfer tokens from Solana to EVM chains without executing code on the destination

## Using Solana as a Destination Chain

Send messages and tokens from EVM chains to Solana:

- [EVM to SVM Guide](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination) - Comprehensive guide for building all types of CCIP messages from EVM chains to Solana
- [Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination/token-transfers) - Transfer tokens from EVM chains to Solana wallets
- [Arbitrary Messaging](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination/arbitrary-messaging) - Send data from EVM chains to execute programs on Solana

## Architecture Reference

Key Differences from EVM:

- **Account Model:** Solana uses an account-based architecture where programs are stateless and all data is stored in accounts
- **PDAs:** Program Derived Addresses provide deterministic storage for Solana programs
- **Explicit Access:** Programs can only access accounts explicitly provided to them
- **Token Accounts:** Each token requires a separate Associated Token Account (ATA)

Message Types:

- **Token Transfers:** Send tokens across chains without program execution
- **Arbitrary Messaging:** Send data to trigger program execution on the destination chain
- **Programmable Token Transfers:** Send both tokens and data in a single message to trigger program execution with token transfers

<Aside type="note">
  These tutorials use the Solana Devnet and Ethereum Sepolia testnet for demonstration purposes. When deploying to
  production, make sure to thoroughly test your implementation and follow all security best practices.
