This tutorial demonstrates how to transfer tokens from an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain to a Solana wallet using Chainlink CCIP. You will learn how to build a CCIP message on an EVM chain, send it to the CCIP router, and verify the transfer on the destination chain.

<Aside type="note" title="Prerequisites">
  Make sure you understand how to [build CCIP messages from EVM to Solana](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination) before
  beginning this tutorial.

## Introduction

This tutorial covers transferring tokens from Ethereum Sepolia to a Solana wallet without any additional data payload or program execution.

## What You will Build

In this tutorial, you will:

- Configure a CCIP message for token-only transfers
- Send CCIP-BnM test tokens from Ethereum Sepolia to a Solana wallet
- Pay for CCIP transaction fees using LINK tokens
- Monitor and verify your cross-chain transfer

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Development Environment**:

   - Node.js v20 or higher. You can use the [nvm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) to install and switch between Node.js versions.
   - Git for cloning the repository.
   - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for installing dependencies.

1. **Tokens for Testing**:

   - ETH on Sepolia (for transaction gas).
   - LINK on Sepolia (for CCIP fees).
   - CCIP-BnM on Sepolia (tokens to transfer).

1. **Wallets**:

   - An Ethereum wallet with a private key. If you use MetaMask, you can follow this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/) to export your private key.
   - A Solana wallet address to receive tokens. Run the [Solana getting started guide](https://solana.com/docs/toolkit/getting-started) to create a wallet.

1. **RPC URLs**:
   - An Ethereum RPC URL. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

<Aside type="tip" title="Obtaining Test Tokens">

- Get ETH and LINK from the [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/)
- Get CCIP-BnM from the [CCIP test tokens
  page](/ccip/test-tokens)

## Understanding Token Transfers to SVM

This tutorial focuses on token-only transfers from EVM chains to Solana wallets. For detailed information about CCIP message structure and parameters, refer to the [guide on building CCIP messages from EVM to SVM](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination).

Key points specific to token-only transfers:

- **No Program Execution**: Tokens are transferred directly to a wallet without program execution
- **Mandatory Settings**:
  - `computeUnits` **MUST** be set to 0
  - `receiver` field should be set to the default PublicKey (`11111111111111111111111111111111`)
  - The actual recipient is specified in the `tokenReceiver` field
  - `data` field should be empty (`0x`)
  - `allowOutOfOrderExecution` must be `true`

For more details on the CCIP message structure, `extraArgs`, and how the SVM account model works, refer to the [guide on building CCIP messages from EVM to SVM](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination).

## Implementing Token Transfers

In this section, you'll implement a token transfer from Ethereum Sepolia to Solana Devnet using the example script located at `ccip-scripts/evm/router/1_token-transfer.ts` in the starter kit.

### Token Transfer Configuration

The most important part of implementing a token transfer is configuring the CCIP message correctly. Here's the key configuration from the script:

```typescript
const MESSAGE_CONFIG = {
  tokenAmounts: [
    {
      address: config.tokenAddress, // BnM token on Ethereum Sepolia
      amount: "1000000000000000", // 0.001 tokens with 18 decimals
    },
  ],
  feeToken: FeeTokenType.LINK, // LINK is used for CCIP fees
  data: "0x", // Empty for token transfers
  extraArgs: {
    computeUnits: 0, // No execution on destination - MUST be 0
    allowOutOfOrderExecution: true, // MUST be true for SVM destinations
    accountIsWritableBitmap: BigInt(0), // No accounts needed
    tokenReceiver: "EPUjBP3Xf76K1VKsDSc6GupBWE8uykNksCLJgXZn87CB", // Recipient's Solana wallet - Change this to your own wallet address
    accounts: [], // No accounts needed for token-only transfers
  },
  receiver: PublicKey.default.toString(), // Use default PublicKey for token transfers
}
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Two Ways to Customize the Wallet Address">

You have two options for customizing the recipient wallet:

1. **Edit the script directly**: Modify the `tokenReceiver`
   value in the code by changing `"EPUjBP3Xf76K1VKsDSc6GupBWE8uykNksCLJgXZn87CB"` to your own Solana wallet address. You can get your Solana address by running `solana address` in your terminal.

   ```bash
   solana address
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   $ solana address
   EPUjBP3Xf76K1VKsDSc6GupBWE8uykNksCLJgXZn87CB
   ```

1. **Use command-line parameters**: Run the script with the `--token-receiver` parameter as shown in the [Running the Token Transfer](#running-the-token-transfer) section below. The command-line parameter will override any value in the code.

</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Critical Settings">

- `computeUnits`: **MUST** be 0 for token-only transfers
- `receiver`: Set to the default PublicKey
  (`11111111111111111111111111111111`)
- `tokenReceiver`: Set to the recipient's Solana wallet address
- `data`: Empty (`0x`) since no data is being sent
- `allowOutOfOrderExecution`: Must be true for Solana destinations

</Aside>

### How the Script Works

The token transfer script handles the complete cross-chain transfer process without requiring you to write any code. The script:

1. Configures the CCIP message with the parameters shown above
1. Calculates the CCIP fees required for the transfer
1. Approves the router to spend your CCIP-BnM tokens (the tokens being transferred)
1. Approves the router to spend your LINK tokens (for paying CCIP fees)
1. Calls the CCIP router contract to execute the cross-chain transfer
1. Returns the transaction details and message ID for tracking

For those interested in implementation details, the script is well-commented and follows a straightforward flow. You can review the source code at `ccip-scripts/evm/router/1_token-transfer.ts` in the starter kit repository.

## Running the Token Transfer

Now that you understand how the script works, execute the token transfer:

1. Ensure you've completed the setup steps outlined earlier
1. Make sure your `.env` file contains the required values
1. Run the script using one of the following options:

**Option A: Run with default settings** (if you modified the script directly):

```bash
npx ts-node ccip-scripts/evm/router/1_token-transfer.ts
```

**Option B: Run with your wallet address as a parameter**:

```bash
npx ts-node ccip-scripts/evm/router/1_token-transfer.ts --token-receiver YOUR_SOLANA_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### Expected Output

When the script executes successfully, you'll see output similar to this:

```

```

The output provides important information to track your transfer:

- Transaction hash and URL for viewing on Etherscan
- Message ID for tracking in the CCIP Explorer
- Confirmation of transfer completion

## Verification and Monitoring

After sending your token transfer, you'll need to:

1. **Track progress with Message ID**: Use the CCIP Explorer link provided in the output to track your message status across chains. You must wait for the transfer to be successful before proceeding to verification.

1. **Solana Explorer**: Once the transfer is successful, verify token receipt on the Solana Explorer:
   - Visit [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet)
   - Search for your Solana wallet address
   - Look for the transferred token in the "Tokens" section

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

| Issue                   | Possible Cause                  | Solution                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Insufficient funds      | Not enough ETH for gas          | Add more ETH to your wallet                         |
| Insufficient tokens     | Not enough CCIP-BnM to transfer | Get more tokens from the faucet                     |
| Insufficient fee tokens | Not enough LINK for CCIP fees   | Get more LINK from the faucet                       |
| Transaction reverted    | Incorrect configuration         | Ensure `computeUnits` is 0 for token transfers      |
| Transfer not received   | Patience needed                 | CCIP transfers can take several minutes to finalize |
| Invalid recipient       | Incorrect Solana address format | Ensure the Solana address is valid (base58 encoded) |
