This section provides comprehensive guides and tutorials for implementing cross‑chain communication from Ethereum (EVM) to Solana using Chainlink CCIP.

## Getting Started

Before implementing specific use cases, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts and message structure for EVM to SVM communication:

- [Building CCIP Messages from EVM to Solana](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination/build-messages) - Learn the core message structure, required parameters, and implementation details for all message types

## Tutorials by Use Case

Depending on your specific needs, choose the appropriate tutorial:

- [Token Transfers](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination/token-transfers) - Send tokens from EVM chains to Solana wallets without program execution
- [Arbitrary Messaging](/ccip/tutorials/svm/destination/arbitrary-messaging) - Send data from EVM chains to trigger program execution on Solana
