Learn how to implement cross-chain tokens using Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on SVM-based blockchains like Solana.

## [BurnMint with Direct Mint Authority Transfer](/ccip/tutorials/svm/cross-chain-tokens/direct-mint-authority)

This tutorial demonstrates how to create tokens that can seamlessly transfer between Solana Devnet and Ethereum Sepolia using the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard with direct mint authority transfer for development environments.

## [BurnMint with SPL Token Multisig Tutorial](/ccip/tutorials/svm/cross-chain-tokens/spl-token-multisig-tutorial)

This educational tutorial demonstrates how to learn SPL token multisig concepts for cross-chain tokens, providing foundational understanding of multisig architecture and distributed control while enabling autonomous CCIP operations. Ideal for understanding multisig concepts before implementing production systems.
