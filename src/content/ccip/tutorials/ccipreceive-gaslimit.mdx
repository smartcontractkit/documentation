title: "Optimizing Gas Limit Settings in CCIP Messages"
---

When constructing a [CCIP message](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#evm2anymessage), it's crucial to set the gas limit accurately. The gas limit represents the maximum amount of gas consumed to execute the [`ccipReceive`](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/ccip-receiver#ccipreceive) function on the CCIP Receiver, which influences the transaction fees for sending a CCIP message. Notably, unused gas is not reimbursed, making it essential to estimate the gas limit carefully:

- Setting the gas limit too low will cause the transaction to revert when CCIP calls `ccipReceive` on the CCIP Receiver, which requires a manual re-execution with an increased gas limit. For more details about this scenario, read the [Manual Execution](/ccip/tutorials/manual-execution) guide.
- Conversely, an excessively high gas limit leads to higher fees.

This tutorial shows you how to estimate the gas limit for the `ccipReceive` function using various methods. You will learn how to use a CCIP Receiver where the gas consumption of the `ccipReceive` function varies based on the input data. This example emphasizes the need for testing under diverse conditions. This tutorial includes tasks for the following environments:

1. **Local Environment**: Using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) on a local blockchain provides a swift initial gas estimate. However, different frameworks can yield different results and the local environment will not always be representative of your destination blockchain. Consider these figures to be preliminary estimates. Then, incorporate a buffer and conduct subsequent validations on a testnet.
1. **Testnet**: You can precisely determine the required gas limit by deploying your CCIP Sender and Receiver on a testnet and transmitting several CCIP messages with the previously estimated gas. Although this approach is more time-intensive, especially if testing across multiple blockchains, it offers enhanced accuracy.
1. **Offchain Methods**: Estimating gas with an offchain Web3 provider or tools like [Tenderly](https://docs.tenderly.co/) offers the most accurate and swift way to determine the needed gas limit.

These approaches will give you insights into accurately estimating the gas limit for the `ccipReceive` function, ensuring cost-effective CCIP transactions.

Before you begin, open a terminal, clone the [smart-contract-examples repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples), and navigate to the `smart-contract-examples/ccip/estimate-gas` directory.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git && \
    cd smart-contract-examples/ccip/estimate-gas
    ```

## Examine the code

The source code for the CCIP Sender and Receiver is located in the `contracts` directory for Hardhat projects and in the `src` directory for Foundry projects. The code includes detailed comments for clarity and is designed to ensure self-explanatory functionality. This section focuses on the `_ccipReceive` function:

```solidity
function _ccipReceive(Client.Any2EVMMessage memory any2EvmMessage) internal override {
  uint256 iterations = abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.data, (uint256));

  uint256 result = iterations;
  uint256 maxIterations = iterations % 100;
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < maxIterations; i++) {
    result += i;
  }

  emit MessageReceived(
    any2EvmMessage.messageId,
    any2EvmMessage.sourceChainSelector,
    abi.decode(any2EvmMessage.sender, (address)),
    iterations,
    maxIterations,
    result
  );
}
```

The `_ccipReceive` function operates as follows:

1. **Input Processing:** The function accepts a `Client.Any2EVMMessage`. The first step involves decoding the number of iterations from the message's data using ABI decoding.
1. **Logic Execution:** It initializes the `result` variable with the number of iterations. The function calculates `maxIterations` by taking the modulo of iterations with 100, which sets an upper limit for iteration. This step is a safeguard to ensure that the function does not run out of gas.
1. **Iteration:** The function executes a loop from 0 to `maxIterations`, simulating variable computational work based on the input data. This variability directly influences gas consumption.
1. **Event Emission:** Finally, an event `MessageReceived` is emitted.

This code shows how gas consumption for the `_ccipReceive` function can fluctuate in response to the input data, highlighting the necessity for thorough testing under different scenarios to determine the correct `gasLimit`.

## Gas estimation in a local environment

To facilitate testing within a local environment, you will use the [MockCCIPRouter](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/tree/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.1/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/test/mocks/MockRouter.sol) contract. This contract serves as a mock implementation of the CCIP Router contract, enabling the local testing of CCIP Sender and Receiver contracts.
A notable feature of the `MockCCIPRouter` contract is its ability to emit a `MsgExecuted` event:

```solidity
event MsgExecuted(bool success, bytes retData, uint256 gassed))
```

This event reports the amount of gas consumed by the `ccipReceive` function.

### Foundry

#### Prerequisites

1. In your terminal, change to the `foundry` directory:

   ```bash
   cd foundry
   ```

1. Ensure Foundry is [installed](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

1. Check the Foundry version:

   ```bash
   forge --version
   ```

   The output should be similar to the following:

   ```text
   forge 0.2.0 (545cd0b 2024-03-14T00:20:00.210934000Z)
   ```

   You need version 0.2.0 or above. Run `foundryup` to update Foundry if necessary.

1. Build your project:

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

   The output should be similar to:

   ```text
   [⠊] Compiling...
   [⠔] Compiling 52 files with 0.8.19
   [⠑] Solc 0.8.19 finished in 2.55s
   Compiler run successful!
   ```

#### Estimate gas

Located in the `test` directory, the `SendReceive.t.sol` test file assesses the gas consumption of the `ccipReceive` function. This file features a test case that sends a CCIP message to the `MockCCIPRouter` contract, which triggers the `MsgExecuted` event. This event provides insights into the gas requirements of the `ccipReceive` function by detailing the amount of gas consumed. The test case explores three scenarios to examine gas usage comprehensively across various operational conditions:

- **Baseline gas consumption:** This scenario runs `0` iteration to determine the baseline gas consumption, representing the least amount of gas required.
- **Average gas consumption:** This scenario runs `50` iterations to estimate the gas consumption under average operational conditions.
- **Peak gas consumption:** This scenario runs `99` iterations to estimate the peak gas consumption, marking the upper limit of gas usage.

To run the test, execute the following command:

```bash
forge test -vv --isolate
```

Output example:

```text
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠘] Compiling 52 files with 0.8.19
[⠃] Solc 0.8.19 finished in 2.72s
Compiler run successful!

```

This table summarizes the gas usage for different iterations:

| Scenario                 | Number of iterations | Gas used |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------- |
| Baseline gas consumption | 0                    | 5190     |
| Average gas consumption  | 50                   | 14740    |
| Peak gas consumption     | 99                   | 24099    |

The output demonstrates that gas consumption increases with the number of iterations, peaking when the iteration count reaches `99`.
In the next section, you will compare these results with those obtained from a local Hardhat environment.

### Hardhat

#### Prerequisites

1.  In your terminal, navigate to the `hardhat` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../hardhat
    ```

1.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash

    Compiled 33 Solidity files successfully (evm target: paris).
    ```

#### Estimate gas

Located in the `test` directory, the `Send-Receive.ts` test file is designed to evaluate the gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function. This file employs the same logic as the Foundry test file, featuring three scenarios varying by the number of iterations. The test case transmits a CCIP message to the `MockCCIPRouter` contract, triggering the `MsgExecuted` event. This event provides insights into the gas requirements of the `ccipReceive` function by detailing the amount of gas used.

To run the test, execute the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Example of the output:

```text
  Sender and Receiver
Final Gas Usage Report:
Number of iterations 0 - Gas used: 5168
Number of iterations 50 - Gas used: 14718
Number of iterations 99 - Gas used: 24077
    ✔ should CCIP message from sender to receiver (1716ms)


  1 passing (2s)
```

This table summarizes the gas usage across different iterations:

| Scenario                 | Number of iterations | Gas used |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------- |
| Baseline gas consumption | 0                    | 5168     |
| Average gas consumption  | 50                   | 14718    |
| Peak gas consumption     | 99                   | 24077    |

The output demonstrates that gas consumption increases with the number of iterations, peaking when the iteration count reaches `99`.

### Compare the results from Foundry and Hardhat

This table summarizes the gas usage for different iterations from both Foundry and Hardhat:

| Scenario                 | Number of iterations | Gas used (Foundry) | Gas used (Hardhat) |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Baseline gas consumption | 0                    | 5190               | 5168               |
| Average gas consumption  | 50                   | 14740              | 14718              |
| Peak gas consumption     | 99                   | 24099              | 24077              |

Gas usage trends across different iterations are consistent between Foundry and Hardhat and increase with the number of iterations, reaching a peak at 99. However, slight variations in gas usage between the two environments at each iteration level demonstrate the importance of extending gas usage estimation beyond local environment testing. To accurately determine the appropriate gas limit, it is recommended to conduct additional validations on the target blockchain. Setting the gas limit with a buffer is advisable to account for differences between local environment estimations and actual gas usage on the target blockchain.

### Estimate gas usage on your local environment

Now that you've locally estimated the gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function using the provided projects, you can apply the same approach to your own Foundry or Hardhat project. This section will guide you through estimating gas usage in your Foundry or Hardhat project.

#### Estimate `ccipReceive` gas usage locally in your Foundry project

To estimate the gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function within your own Foundry project, follow these steps:

1. Create a testing file in the `test` directory of your project and import the [`MockCCIPRouter`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/tree/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.1/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/test/mocks/MockRouter.sol) contract:

   ```solidity
   import { MockCCIPRouter } from "@chainlink/contracts-ccip/src/v0.8/ccip/test/mocks/MockRouter.sol";
   ```

   **_Note_:** The `MockCCIPRouter` receives the CCIP message from your CCIP Sender, calls the `ccipReceive` function on your CCIP Receiver, and emits the `MsgExecuted` event with the gas used.

1. Inside the `setUp` function, deploy the `MockCCIPRouter` contract, and use its address to deploy your CCIP Sender and CCIP Receiver contracts. For more details, check this [example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/ccip/estimate-gas/foundry/test/SendReceive.t.sol#L23).

1. In your test cases:

   1. Before transmitting any CCIP messages, use `vm.recordLogs()` to start capturing events. For more details, check this [example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/ccip/estimate-gas/foundry/test/SendReceive.t.sol#L39).

   1. After sending the CCIP message, use `vm.getRecordedLogs()` to collect the recorded logs. For more details, check this [example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/4b3800967e475ecd990fd417bec9960dd9ebe2af/ccip/estimate-gas/foundry/test/SendReceive.t.sol#L47C32-L47C52).

   1. Parse the logs to find the `MsgExecuted(bool,bytes,uint256)` event and extract the gas used. For more details, check this [example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/ccip/estimate-gas/foundry/test/SendReceive.t.sol#L53).

#### Estimate `ccipReceive` gas usage locally in your Hardhat project

To estimate the gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function within your own Hardhat project, follow these steps:

1. Create a Solidity file in the `contracts` directory of your project and import the [`MockCCIPRouter`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip/tree/release/contracts-ccip-1.5.1/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/test/mocks/MockRouter.sol) contract:

   ```solidity
   import { MockCCIPRouter } from "@chainlink/contracts-ccip/src/v0.8/ccip/test/mocks/MockRouter.sol";
   ```

   **_Note_:** The `MockCCIPRouter` receives the CCIP message from your CCIP Sender, calls the `ccipReceive` function on your CCIP Receiver, and emits the `MsgExecuted` event with the gas used.

1. Create a testing file in your project's `test` directory.
1. Inside the `deployFixture` function, deploy the `MockCCIPRouter` contract and use its address to deploy your CCIP Sender and CCIP Receiver contracts. For more details, check this [example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/4b3800967e475ecd990fd417bec9960dd9ebe2af/ccip/estimate-gas/hardhat/test/Send-Receive.ts#L14).
1. In your test cases:

   1. Send the CCIP message to the `MockCCIPRouter` contract. For more details, check this [example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/4b3800967e475ecd990fd417bec9960dd9ebe2af/ccip/estimate-gas/hardhat/test/Send-Receive.ts#L51).
   1. Parse the logs to find the `MsgExecuted(bool,bytes,uint256)` event and extract the gas used. For more details, check this [example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/ccip/estimate-gas/hardhat/test/Send-Receive.ts#L59).

## Gas estimation on a testnet

To accurately validate your local environment's gas usage estimations, follow these steps:

1. Deploy and configure the CCIP Sender contract on the Avalanche Fuji testnet and the CCIP Receiver contract on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
1. Send several CCIP messages with the same number of iterations used in your local testing. For this purpose, use the `sendCCIPMessage.ts` script in the `scripts/testing` directory. This script includes a 10% buffer over the estimated gas usage to ensure a sufficient gas limit. Refer to the table below for the buffered gas limits for each iteration:

   | Scenario                 | Number of iterations | Estimated gas usage (Hardhat) | Buffered gas limit (+10%) |
   | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | Baseline gas consumption | 0                    | 5168                          | 5685                      |
   | Average gas consumption  | 50                   | 14718                         | 16190                     |
   | Peak gas consumption     | 99                   | 24077                         | 26485                     |

1. Use [Tenderly](https://dashboard.tenderly.co) to monitor and confirm that the transactions execute successfully within the buffered gas limits. Subsequently, compare the actual gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet against the buffered limits to fine-tune the final gas limit.

This approach ensures that your gas limit settings are validated against real-world conditions on testnets, providing a more accurate and reliable estimation for deploying on live blockchains.

### Deploy and configure the contracts

To deploy and configure the CCIP Sender contract on the Avalanche Fuji testnet and the CCIP Receiver contract on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, follow the steps below. **Note**: Your account must have some ETH tokens on Ethereum Sepolia and AVAX tokens on Avalanche Fuji.

1. Deploy the CCIP Sender on the Avalanche Fuji testnet:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployment/deploySender.ts --network avalancheFuji
   ```

1. Deploy the CCIP Receiver on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployment/deployReceiver.ts --network ethereumSepolia
   ```

1. Authorize the Sender to send messages to Ethereum Sepolia:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/configuration/allowlistingForSender.ts --network avalancheFuji
   ```

1. Authorize the Receiver to receive messages from the Sender:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/configuration/allowlistingForReceiver.ts --network ethereumSepolia
   ```

Upon completion, you will find the CCIP Sender and Receiver contracts deployed and configured on their respective testnets. Contract addresses are available in the `scripts/generatedData.json` file.

### Send CCIP Messages

1. Send three CCIP messages with different numbers of iterations:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/testing/sendCCIPMessages.ts --network avalancheFuji
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   $ npx hardhat run scripts/testing/sendCCIPMessages.ts --network avalancheFuji
   Approving 0x0b9d5D9136855f6FEc3c0993feE6E9CE8a297846 for 0x32A24e40851E19d1eD2a7E697d1a38228e9388a3. Allowance is 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935. Signer 0x9d087fC03ae39b088326b67fA3C788236645b717...

   ```

1. Open the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link), search each message by its ID, and wait for each message to be successfully transmitted (`Status` in the explorer: `Success`).

For the example above, here are the destination transaction hashes:

    | Message id                                                         | Ethereum Sepolia transaction hash                                  |

**Note** that the Ethereum Sepolia transaction hash is the same for all the messages. This is because CCIP batched the messages.

### Check the actual gas usage

1. Open [Tenderly](https://dashboard.tenderly.co) and search for the [destination transaction hash](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/sepolia/0xf004eb6dab30b3cfb9d1d631c3f9832410b8d4b3179e65b85730563b67b1e689).

1. Search for `_callWithExactGasSafeReturnData` with a payload containing your `messageId` (without `0x`). [Example](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/sepolia/0xf004eb6dab30b3cfb9d1d631c3f9832410b8d4b3179e65b85730563b67b1e689?trace=0.8.4.2) for `0xf23b17366d69159ea7d502835c4178a1c1d1d6325edf3d91dca08f2c7a2900f7`.

1. Below the payload with your `messageId`, you will find the call trace from the Router to your Receiver contract. [Call trace example](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/sepolia/0xf004eb6dab30b3cfb9d1d631c3f9832410b8d4b3179e65b85730563b67b1e689?trace=0.8.4.2.0).

1. Click on the _Debugger_ tab and you'll get the gas details:

   ```text
   "gas":{
   "gas_left":5685
   "gas_used":5031
   "total_gas_used":7994315
   }
   ```

1. Note the `gas_left` is equal to the limit that is set in the `sendCCIPMessages.ts` script: `5685`. The `gas_used` is the actual gas used by the Receiver contract to process the message.

1. Repeating the same steps for the other two messages, we can summarize the output:

   | Scenario                 | Number of iterations | Estimated gas usage (Hardhat) | Buffered gas limit (+10%) | Gas used on testnet |

   | Baseline gas consumption | 0                    | 5168                          | 5685                      | 5031                |

Testing on testnets has confirmed that a gas limit of 26,485 is adequate for the `ccipReceive` function to execute successfully under various conditions. However, it is important to note that gas usage may differ across testnets. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct similar validation efforts on the blockchain where you intend to deploy. Deploying and validating contracts across multiple testnets can be time-consuming. For efficiency, consider using [offchain methods](#offchain-methods) to estimate gas usage.

## Offchain methods

This section guides you through estimating gas usage using two different offchain methods:

- A Web3 provider using the [ethers.js `estimateGas`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Provider-estimateGas) function.
- [Tenderly simulation API](https://docs.tenderly.co/reference/api#tag/Simulations/operation/simulateTransaction). The Tenderly simulation API provides a more accurate result (Read this [blog post](https://blog.tenderly.co/how-tenderly-enables-most-accurate-ethereum-gas-estimation/) to learn more) but you are limited to the blockchains supported by Tenderly.

These methods provide the most accurate and rapid means to determine the necessary gas limit for the `ccipReceive` function. You will use the same CCIP Receiver contract deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet in the previous section.

### Prerequisites

1. In your terminal, navigate to the `offchain` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../offchain
   ```

1. Modify the `data.json` file to insert the deployed addresses of your Sender and Receiver contracts.

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Set the password to encrypt your environment variables:

   ```bash
   npx env-enc set-pw
   ```

1. Set up the following environment variables:

   - `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL for Ethereum Sepolia testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.
   - `TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG`: This is one part of your Tenderly API URL. You can [find this value in your Tenderly account](https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects/account-project-slug).
   - `TENDERLY_PROJECT_SLUG`: This is one part of your Tenderly API URL. You can [find this value in your Tenderly account](https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects/account-project-slug).
   - `TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY`: If you don't already have one, you can [generate a new access token](https://docs.tenderly.co/account/projects/how-to-generate-api-access-token).

   Input these variables using the following command:

   ```bash
   npx env-enc set
   ```

1. Generate [Typechain typings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typechain) for the Receiver contract:

   ```bash
   npm run generate-types
   ```

### Introduction of the scripts

The scripts are located in the `src` directory. Each script is self-explanatory and includes comprehensive comments to explain its functionality and usage. There are three scripts:

- `estimateGasProvider.ts`: This script uses the [`eth_estimateGas`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-estimategas) Ethereum API to estimate the gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function. It simulates sending three CCIP messages to the Receiver contract with a varying number of iterations and estimates the gas usage using the [ethers.js `estimateGas`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Provider-estimateGas) function.

- `estimateGasTenderly.ts`: This script leverages the Tenderly `simulate` API to estimate the gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function. Similar to the previous script, it simulates sending three CCIP messages to the Receiver contract with different numbers of iterations and estimates the gas usage using the [Tenderly `simulate` API](https://docs.tenderly.co/reference/api#tag/Simulations/operation/simulateTransaction).

- `helper.ts`: This script contains helper functions used by the other scripts. The two main functions are:

  - `buildTransactionData`: This function constructs a CCIP message for a specified number of iterations and then returns the transaction data.
  - `estimateIntrinsicGas`: Exclusively called by the `estimateGasProvider.ts` script, this function estimates the intrinsic gas of a transaction. The intrinsic gas represents the minimum amount of gas required before executing a transaction. It is determined by the transaction data and the type of transaction. Since this gas is paid by the initiator of the transaction, we use this function to estimate the intrinsic gas and then deduct it from the total gas used to isolate the gas consumed by the `ccipReceive` function.

### Estimate gas using a Web3 provider

Ethereum nodes implement the [`eth_estimateGas`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-estimategas) Ethereum API to predict the gas required for a transaction's successful execution. To estimate the gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function, you can directly call the `eth_estimateGas` API via a Web3 provider or leverage a library like ethers.js, simplifying this interaction. This guide focuses on the [ethers.js `estimateGas`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Provider-estimateGas) function for gas estimation. To estimate the gas usage, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run estimate-gas-provider
```

Example output:

```text
$ npm run estimate-gas-provider

> offchain-simulator@1.0.0 estimate-gas-provider
> ts-node src/estimateGasProvider.ts

Final Gas Usage Report:
Number of iterations 0 - Gas used: 5377
Number of iterations 50 - Gas used: 14946
Number of iterations 99 - Gas used: 24324
```

The estimate may exceed the actual gas used by the transaction for various reasons, including differences in node performance and EVM mechanics. For a more precise estimation, consider using Tenderly (see the next section for details).

### Estimate gas using Tenderly

To estimate the gas usage of the `ccipReceive` function using Tenderly, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run estimate-gas-tenderly
```

Example output:

```text
$ npm run estimate-gas-tenderly

> offchain-simulator@1.0.0 estimate-gas-tenderly
> ts-node src/estimateGasTenderly.ts

Final Gas Usage Report:
Number of iterations 0 - Gas used: 5031
Number of iterations 50 - Gas used: 14581
Number of iterations 99 - Gas used: 23940
```

### Comparison

The table below summarizes the gas estimations for different iterations using both Web3 provider and Tenderly:

| Scenario                 | Number of iterations | Gas estimated (Web3 provider) | Gas estimated (Tenderly) |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Baseline gas consumption | 0                    | 5377                          | 5031                     |
| Average gas consumption  | 50                   | 14946                         | 14581                    |
| Peak gas consumption     | 99                   | 24324                         | 23940                    |

The gas estimations from both Web3 provider and Tenderly are consistent across different iterations and align with actual testnet results. This demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of these offchain methods in estimating gas usage. However, you can notice that Tenderly provides more accurate results.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has guided you through estimating the gas limit for the `ccipReceive` function using various methods. You have learned how to estimate gas usage in a local environment using Hardhat and Foundry, validate these estimations on testnets, and use offchain methods to estimate gas usage.

As we have explored various methods for estimating gas for the `ccipReceive` function, it is crucial to apply this knowledge effectively. Here are some targeted recommendations to enhance your approach to gas estimation:

1. **Comprehensive Testing:** Emphasize testing under diverse scenarios to ensure your gas estimations are robust. Different conditions can significantly affect gas usage, so covering as many cases as possible in your tests is crucial.
1. **Preliminary Local Estimates:** Local testing is a critical first step for estimating gas and ensuring your contracts function correctly under various scenarios. While Hardhat and Foundry facilitate development and testing, it's key to remember that these environments may not perfectly mirror your target blockchain's conditions. These initial estimates serve as valuable insights, guiding you toward more accurate gas limit settings when you proceed to testnet validations. Incorporating a buffer based on these preliminary results can help mitigate the risks of underestimating gas requirements due to environmental differences.
1. **Efficiency with Offchain Methods:** Since testing across different blockchains can be resource-intensive, leaning on offchain methods for gas estimation is invaluable. Tools such as Tenderly not only facilitate rapid and accurate gas usage insights on your target blockchains but also enable you to simulate the execution of the `ccipReceive` function on actual contracts deployed on mainnets. If Tenderly doesn't support a particular blockchain, a practical alternative is to use a Web3 provider that does support that chain, as illustrated in the [Estimate gas using a Web3 provider](#estimate-gas-using-a-web3-provider) section. This is particularly helpful when considering the diversity in gas metering rules across blockchains. This approach saves time and enhances the precision of your gas limit estimations, allowing for more cost-effective transactions from your dApp.
