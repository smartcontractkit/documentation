In this tutorial, you will use Chainlink CCIP to transfer tokens from a smart contract to an account on a different blockchain. First, you will pay for the CCIP fees on the source blockchain using LINK. Then, you will use the same contract to pay CCIP fees in native gas tokens. For example, you would use ETH on Ethereum or AVAX on Avalanche.

<Aside type="caution" title="Transferring tokens">
  This tutorial uses the term "transferring tokens" even though the tokens are not technically transferred. Instead,
  they are locked or burned on the source chain and then unlocked or minted on the destination chain. Read the [Token
  Pools](/ccip/architecture#token-pools) section to understand the various mechanisms that are used to transfer value
  across chains.

## Before you begin

1. You should understand how to write, compile, deploy, and fund a smart contract. If you need to brush up on the basics, read this [tutorial](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract), which will guide you through using the [Solidity programming language](https://soliditylang.org/), interacting with the [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io) and working within the [Remix Development Environment](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

1. Your account must have some AVAX and LINK tokens on _Avalanche Fuji_. Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
1. Check the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) to confirm that the tokens you will transfer are supported for your lane. In this example, you will transfer tokens from _Avalanche Fuji_ to _Ethereum Sepolia_ so check the list of supported tokens [here](/ccip/directory/testnet/chain/avalanche-fuji-testnet).
1. Learn how to [acquire CCIP test tokens](/ccip/test-tokens#mint-test-tokens). Following this guide, you should have CCIP-BnM tokens, and CCIP-BnM should appear in the list of your tokens in MetaMask.
1. Learn how to [fund your contract](/resources/fund-your-contract). This guide shows how to fund your contract in LINK, but you can use the same guide to fund your contract with any ERC20 tokens as long as they appear in the list of tokens in MetaMask.

## Tutorial

<CcipCommon callout="useSimulator" />

In this tutorial, you will transfer [CCIP-BnM](/ccip/test-tokens#tokens) tokens from a contract on Avalanche Fuji to an account on Ethereum Sepolia. First, you will pay [CCIP fees in LINK](#transfer-tokens-and-pay-in-link), then you will pay [CCIP fees in native gas](#transfer-tokens-and-pay-in-native). The destination account can be an [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) or a smart contract. Moreover, the example shows how to transfer CCIP-BnM tokens, but you can re-use the same example to transfer other tokens as long as they are supported for your [lane](/ccip/concepts#lane).

<CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/TokenTransferor.sol" />

### Deploy your contracts

To use this contract:

1. [Open the contract in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/TokenTransferor.sol).

1. Compile your contract.
1. Deploy and fund your sender contract on _Avalanche Fuji_:

   1. Open MetaMask and select the _Avalanche Fuji_ network.
   1. In Remix IDE, click _Deploy & Run Transactions_ and select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ from the environment list. Remix will then interact with your MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Avalanche Fuji_.
   1. Fill in your blockchain's router and LINK contract addresses. The router address can be found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory) and the LINK contract address on the [LINK token contracts page](/resources/link-token-contracts). For _Avalanche Fuji_:

      - The router address is <CopyText text="0xF694E193200268f9a4868e4Aa017A0118C9a8177" code/>,
      - The LINK contract address is <CopyText text="0x0b9d5D9136855f6FEc3c0993feE6E9CE8a297846" code/>.

   1. Click the **transact** button. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears on the _Deployed Contracts_ list.
      Note your contract address.
   1. Open MetaMask and fund your contract with CCIP-BnM tokens. You can transfer <CopyText text="0.002" code/> _CCIP-BnM_ to your contract.

1. Enable your contract to transfer tokens to _Ethereum Sepolia_:
   1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of functions for your smart contract deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_.
   1. Call the `allowlistDestinationChain` function with <CopyText text="16015286601757825753" code/> as the destination chain selector, and <CopyText text="true" code/> as allowed. Each chain selector is found on the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory).

### Transfer tokens and pay in LINK

You will transfer _0.001 CCIP-BnM_. The CCIP fees for using CCIP will be paid in LINK. Read this [explanation](#transferring-tokens-and-pay-in-link) for a detailed description of the code example.

1.  Open MetaMask and connect to _Avalanche Fuji_. Fund your contract with LINK tokens. You can transfer <CopyText text="70" code/> _LINK_ to your contract. **Note**: The LINK tokens are used to pay for CCIP fees.

    **Note:** This transaction fee is significantly higher than normal due to gas spikes on Sepolia. To run this example, you can get additional testnet LINK
    from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link) or use a supported testnet other than Sepolia.

1.  Transfer CCIP-BnM from _Avalanche Fuji_:

    1. Open MetaMask and select the network _Avalanche Fuji_.
    1. In Remix IDE, under _Deploy & Run Transactions_, open the list of functions for your smart contract deployed on _Avalanche Fuji_.

    1. Fill in the arguments of the _**transferTokensPayLINK**_ function:

       <br />

## Explanation

<CcipCommon callout="importCCIPPackage" />

The smart contract featured in this tutorial is designed to interact with CCIP to transfer a supported token to an account on a destination chain. The contract code contains supporting comments clarifying the functions, events, and underlying logic. This section further explains initializing the contract and transferring tokens.

### Initializing of the contract

When you deploy the contract, you define the router address and LINK contract address of the blockchain where you deploy the contract. The contract uses the router address to interact with the router to estimate the CCIP fees and the transmission of CCIP messages.

### Transferring tokens and pay in LINK

The `transferTokensPayLINK` function undertakes six primary operations:

1. Call the `_buildCCIPMessage` private function to construct a CCIP-compatible message using the `EVM2AnyMessage` [struct](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#any2evmmessage):

   - The `_receiver` address is encoded in bytes to accommodate non-EVM destination blockchains with distinct address formats. The encoding is achieved through [abi.encode](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html).
   - The `data` is empty because you only transfer tokens.
   - The `tokenAmounts` is an array, with each element comprising a [`EVMTokenAmount` struct](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#evmtokenamount) that contains the token address and amount. The array contains one element where the `_token` (token address) and `_amount` (token amount) are passed by the user when calling the `transferTokensPayLINK` function.
   - The `extraArgs` specifies the `gasLimit` for relaying the message to the recipient contract on the destination blockchain. In this example, the `gasLimit` is set to `0` because the contract only transfers tokens and does not expect function calls on the destination blockchain.
   - The `_feeTokenAddress` designates the token address used for CCIP fees. Here, `address(linkToken)` signifies payment in LINK.

     {" "}

     <CcipCommon callout="senderContractCallout" />

1. Computes the fees by invoking the router's `getFee` [function](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/i-router-client#getfee).
1. Ensures your contract balance in LINK is enough to cover the fees.
1. Grants the router contract permission to deduct the fees from the contract's LINK balance.
1. Grants the router contract permission to deduct the amount from the contract's _CCIP-BnM_ balance.
1. Dispatches the CCIP message to the destination chain by executing the router's `ccipSend` [function](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/i-router-client#ccipsend).

**Note**: As a security measure, the `transferTokensPayLINK` function is protected by the `onlyAllowlistedChain` to ensure the contract owner has allowlisted a destination chain.

### Transferring tokens and pay in native

The `transferTokensPayNative` function undertakes five primary operations:

1. Call the `_buildCCIPMessage` private function to construct a CCIP-compatible message using the `EVM2AnyMessage` [struct](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#any2evmmessage):

   - The `_receiver` address is encoded in bytes to accommodate non-EVM destination blockchains with distinct address formats. The encoding is achieved through [abi.encode](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html).
   - The `data` is empty because you only transfer tokens.
   - The `tokenAmounts` is an array, with each element comprising an `EVMTokenAmount` [struct](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#evmtokenamount) containing the token address and amount. The array contains one element where the `_token` (token address) and `_amount` (token amount) are passed by the user when calling the `transferTokensPayNative` function.
   - The `extraArgs` specifies the `gasLimit` for relaying the message to the recipient contract on the destination blockchain. In this example, the `gasLimit` is set to `0` because the contract only transfers tokens and does not expect function calls on the destination blockchain.
   - The `_feeTokenAddress` designates the token address used for CCIP fees. Here, `address(0)` signifies payment in native gas tokens (ETH).

     {" "}

     <CcipCommon callout="senderContractCallout" />

1. Computes the fees by invoking the router's `getFee` [function](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/i-router-client#getfee).
1. Ensures your contract balance in native gas is enough to cover the fees.
1. Grants the router contract permission to deduct the amount from the contract's _CCIP-BnM_ balance.
1. Dispatches the CCIP message to the destination chain by executing the router's `ccipSend` [function](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/i-router-client#ccipsend). **Note**: `msg.value` is set because you pay in native gas.

**Note**: As a security measure, the `transferTokensPayNative` function is protected by the `onlyAllowlistedChain`, ensuring the contract owner has allowlisted a destination chain.
