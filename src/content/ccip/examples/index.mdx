Several example dApps and tools are available to help you learn about use cases for CCIP.

## CCIP Direct Staking

[CCIP Direct Staking](https://github.com/Aphyla/chainlink-csr) enables users to stake native tokens on supported L2 networks and receive liquid staked tokens (LSTs, e.g., wstETH) directly on the same chain. Supports both instant (fast) and delayed (slow) staking options.

Learn more about the architecture and workflow in the [technical blog post](https://blog.chain.link/scaling-staking-protocols-cross-chain/).

For third-party integrators who want to build offchain components to interact with CCIP Direct Staking contracts, see the [Direct Staking integration guide](/quickstarts/ccip-direct-staking) with reference implementations and utilities. The guide includes a hands-on tutorial using [Lido](https://lido.fi/) on Base Mainnet.

## CCIP Starter Kits

The CCIP Starter Kits demonstrate how to transfer tokens and send messages using the HardHat or Foundry frameworks.

- [HardHat CCIP Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-hardhat)
- [Foundry CCIP Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-foundry)

## CCIP Tic Tac Toe

[CCIP Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-tic-tac-toe) demonstrates how to build a gaming dApp that operates across multiple blockchain networks.

## Cross-chain name service

The [Cross-chain Name Service](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-cross-chain-name-service) is an educational example of how to create a minimal cross-chain name service using Chainlink CCIP.

## DeFi lending

The [DeFi Lending](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-defi-lending) examples shows how a cross-chain lending application can work using CCIP.

## DeFi liquidation protection

The [DeFi liquidation protection](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-liquidation-protector) example shows how a DeFi dApp can use CCIP to prevent liquidation when lending assets across multiple blockchain networks.

## Cross Chain NFT

The [Cross Chain NFT](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-cross-chain-nft) example shows you how to mint an NFT on one blockchain from another blockchain.
