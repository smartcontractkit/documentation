The [`ccip-tools-ts`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-tools-ts) monorepo provides TypeScript tooling for interacting with CCIP contracts:

- **CCIP SDK (`@chainlink/ccip-sdk`)**: A TypeScript library for programmatic interaction with CCIP contracts
- **CCIP CLI (`@chainlink/ccip-cli`)**: A command-line interface built on top of the SDK

## Features

- Query CCIP message details using transaction hashes
- Send cross-chain messages and token transfers
- Manually execute messages on the destination chain
- Estimate gas for CCIP transactions
- Inspect lane configurations and supported tokens
- Parse and debug raw CCIP transaction data

## Documentation

For installation, API reference, and usage examples, see the [CCIP Tools documentation](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tools/).
