import { Aside } from "@components"

The Chainlink CCIP **JavaScript SDK** provides developers with libraries and UI components to integrate CCIP functionality directly into their web applications for **EVM-compatible chains**.

This allows for the creation of custom user interfaces for initiating and managing cross-chain token transfers and messages via CCIP.

**GitHub Repository:** [smartcontractkit/ccip-javascript-sdk](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-javascript-sdk/tree/main)

## Key Packages

The SDK is composed of two main packages:

- **`@chainlink/ccip-js`**: A TypeScript library providing the core client logic for interacting with CCIP routers and managing cross-chain transfers.
- **`@chainlink/ccip-react-components`**: A set of pre-built, customizable React UI components built on top of `ccip-js`. These components help accelerate the development of CCIP-enabled frontends.

## Use Cases

- Embed a fully featured, stylable CCIP token bridge within your dApp.
- Build custom logic around CCIP transfers using the core `ccip-js` library.
- Monitor CCIP transaction status programmatically within your application.
