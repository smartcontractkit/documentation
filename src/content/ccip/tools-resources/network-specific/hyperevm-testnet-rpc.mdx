## Overview

To enhance the HyperEVM developer experience we are providing free public access to our professionally hosted Testnet RPC endpoint. Developers can use this to build Hyperliquid applications and as a testnet RPC endpoint in the browser wallet. For mainnet deployments, see available mainnet RPC urls on the [Hyperliquid docs](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/builder-tools/hyperevm-tools).

## RPC Endpoint Details

- **Network Name**: HyperEVM Testnet
- **RPC URL**: https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet
- **Chain ID**: 998
- **Currency Symbol**: HYPE
- **Block Explorer URL (Optional)**: https://testnet.purrsec.com/

## For Developers: Building with the RPC

You can use this endpoint in your dApps, scripts, or backend services with any standard Web3 library.

### Ethers.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers"

const rpcUrl = "https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet"
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl)

async function getBlock() {
  const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber()
  console.log("Current Block Number:", blockNumber)
}

getBlock()
```

### Web3.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)

```javascript
import Web3 from "web3"

const rpcUrl = "https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet"
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(rpcUrl))

async function getBlock() {
  const blockNumber = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber()
  console.log("Current Block Number:", blockNumber)
}

getBlock()
```

### Web3.py (Python)

```python
from web3 import Web3

rpc_url =  "https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet"
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_url))

if w3.is_connected():
    print("Connected to RPC!")
    block_number = w3.eth.block_number
    print("Current Block Number:", block_number)
else:
    print("Failed to connect.")
```

### cURL (Testing)

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
      https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet
```

**Expected Response**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x1f92031" }
```
