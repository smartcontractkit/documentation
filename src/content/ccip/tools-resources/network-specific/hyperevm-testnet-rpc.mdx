<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">
  This RPC is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. Use is at your own risk, Chainlink Labs and its
  affiliates are not liable for any losses, damages, or interruptions arising from its use. The RPC may be modified or
  unavailable at any time, and users are solely responsible for their interactions and compliance with applicable laws.
</Aside>

To enhance the HyperEVM developer experience, we provide free public access to our professionally hosted Testnet RPC endpoint. Developers can use this endpoint to build Hyperliquid applications and configure it as a testnet RPC in browser wallets. For mainnet deployments, see available mainnet RPC URLs on the [Hyperliquid docs](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/builder-tools/hyperevm-tools).

## RPC Endpoint Details

- **Network Name**: HyperEVM Testnet
- **RPC URL**: https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet
- **Chain ID**: 998
- **Currency Symbol**: HYPE
- **Block Explorer URL (Optional)**: https://testnet.purrsec.com/

## For Developers: Building with the RPC

You can use this endpoint in your dApps, scripts, or backend services with any standard Web3 library.

### Ethers.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)

[Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) is a library for interacting with Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers"

const rpcUrl = "https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet"
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl)

async function getBlock() {
  const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber()
  console.log("Current Block Number:", blockNumber)
}

getBlock()
```

### Viem (JavaScript/TypeScript)

[Viem](https://viem.sh/) is a TypeScript library for interacting with Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. It provides modular, type-safe APIs as an alternative to ethers.js.

```javascript
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem"

const rpcUrl = "https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet"

const client = createPublicClient({
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
})

async function getBlock() {
  const blockNumber = await client.getBlockNumber()
  console.log("Current Block Number:", blockNumber)
}

getBlock()
```

### Web3.py (Python)

[Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/) is a Python library for interacting with EVM-compatible chains.

```python
from web3 import Web3

rpc_url = "https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet"
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(rpc_url))

if w3.is_connected():
    print("Connected to RPC!")
    block_number = w3.eth.block_number
    print("Current Block Number:", block_number)
else:
    print("Failed to connect.")
```

### cURL (Testing)

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
     https://rpcs.chain.link/hyperevm/testnet
```

**Expected Response**:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x1f92031" }
```
