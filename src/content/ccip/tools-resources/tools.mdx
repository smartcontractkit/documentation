This page lists tools developed to assist with building and interacting with Chainlink CCIP.

## CCIP Tools TS (`ccip-tools-ts`)

[GitHub Repository: smartcontractkit/ccip-tools-ts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-tools-ts)

This is a TypeScript command-line interface (CLI) and library designed for interacting with deployed CCIP contracts on supported blockchains.

**Key Features:**

- **Query CCIP Data:** View details about specific CCIP messages using transaction hashes (`show`).
- **Manual Execution:** Manually trigger the execution of CCIP messages on the destination chain (`manualExec`).
- **Send Messages:** Construct and send new CCIP messages, including data and token transfers (`send`).
- **Estimate Gas:** Calculate the estimated gas required for a CCIP message execution (`estimateGas`).
- **Lane Information:** Inspect the configuration of specific CCIP lanes (`lane`).
- **Token Discovery:** Check which tokens are supported for transfer on a given lane (`getSupportedTokens`).
- **Debugging:** Parse raw EVM transaction data related to CCIP contracts (`parseBytes`).

This tool is useful for debugging interactions, automating tasks, verifying configurations, and manually interacting with the CCIP protocol. It requires RPC endpoint configuration and wallet access (private key or Ledger) for certain commands.

<Aside type="note">The ccip-tools-ts tool is intended for convenience and illustration.</Aside>

## CCIP Contracts Package (`@chainlink/contracts-ccip`)

[NPM Package: @chainlink/contracts-ccip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip)

This npm package contains the official Solidity smart contracts for Chainlink CCIP. It is essential for developers building applications or smart contracts that integrate directly with the CCIP protocol on EVM-compatible chains.

**Contents:**

- Solidity interfaces for core CCIP contracts (Router, Receiver, etc.).
- Libraries for constructing and handling CCIP messages (e.g., `Client.sol`).
- Implementations of core application contracts (e.g., `CCIPReceiver.sol`).
- ABIs for all included contracts.

Install it in your Solidity project using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @chainlink/contracts-ccip
# or
yarn add @chainlink/contracts-ccip
```

You can then import the necessary contracts and interfaces directly into your Solidity code. E.g.:

```solidity
import '@chainlink/contracts-ccip/src/v0.8/ccip/applications/CCIPReceiver.sol';
import '@chainlink/contracts-ccip/src/v0.8/ccip/interfaces/IRouterClient.sol';
```
