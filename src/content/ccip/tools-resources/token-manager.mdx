The CCIP Token Manager is a web interface designed to simplify the deployment, configuration, and management of Cross-Chain Tokens for use with Chainlink CCIP.

It provides guided workflows for token developers, abstracting away much of the complexity involved in setting up tokens for cross-chain transfers.

**Access the Token Manager:**

- **Mainnet:** [https://tokenmanager.chain.link/](https://tokenmanager.chain.link/)
- **Testnet:** [https://test.tokenmanager.chain.link/](https://test.tokenmanager.chain.link/)

## Key Features & Workflows

- **Deploy New Tokens**: Guides users through deploying a new token contract from scratch and configuring it for CCIP, primarily using the Burn & Mint mechanism.
- **Enable Existing Tokens**: Assists in making already-deployed tokens cross-chain capable by deploying and configuring the necessary CCIP token pool contracts.
- **Configuration Management**: Allows token administrators (once connected via wallet) to manage certain token pool settings, such as rate limits.
- **Admin Role Management**: Facilitates the process of registering and accepting administrative roles for token pools.
- **Token Verification**: Provides a process to request token verification for listing in the CCIP Directory.
- **Dashboard View**: Offers a dashboard to view and manage tokens associated with the connected wallet.
