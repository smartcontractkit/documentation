The [Chainlink CCIP Explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/) is a tool for monitoring the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol network and tracking the status of cross-chain messages.

It provides visibility into CCIP operations, enabling developers and users to verify transaction progress and understand network activity.

## Key Features

- **Transaction Tracking**: View the latest CCIP transactions processed across supported blockchains. You can search for specific transactions using their unique Message ID.
- **Network & Lane Status**: Observe the status of supported networks and the communication lanes between them. This includes access to network and lane configuration details.

Use the CCIP Explorer to gain insights into message processing times, monitor network health, and confirm the successful execution of your cross-chain interactions.
