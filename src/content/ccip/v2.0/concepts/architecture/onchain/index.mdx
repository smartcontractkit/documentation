This section details the onchain components of the CCIP architecture, including routers, onramps, offramps, commit stores, token pools, and receiver contracts or programs. These components operate directly on blockchains to enable secure cross-chain communication. The implementation varies by blockchain family (EVM, Solana, Aptos), but the core architecture remains consistent across all supported chains.
