# Implementing CCIP Receivers for Aptos

This reference guide explains the key components and security patterns required for building Aptos Move modules that can receive cross-chain messages via Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).

## Introduction

A CCIP Receiver is an Aptos Move module that contains a `ccip_receive` entry function and is registered with the CCIP `ReceiverRegistry`. This allows it to process incoming cross-chain messages, handling both arbitrary data payloads and/or token transfers, serving as the on-chain destination endpoint for CCIP messages.

## Security Architecture

To build a secure CCIP receiver, you need to understand how your module interacts with the core CCIP on-chain components. The security model relies on a chain of trust originating from the authorized CCIP Off-Ramp module.

    The on-chain architecture consists of:

    1.  **Receiver Module** (your custom Move module)
        -   Implements the `ccip_receive` entry function.
        -   Is registered with the `ReceiverRegistry`.
        -   Should validate that messages come from an authorized Off-Ramp.

    2.  **CCIP Off-Ramp Module**
        -   The only module authorized to deliver messages to your receiver.
        -   Calls your module via the secure `ReceiverDispatcher`.

    3.  **CCIP Receiver Registry & Dispatcher**
        -   The `ReceiverRegistry` maintains a list of valid receiver modules.
        -   The `ReceiverDispatcher` ensures only the Off-Ramp can trigger a `ccip_receive` call on a registered module.

    The security model is layered, combining guarantees provided by the CCIP protocol with validations you must implement.

    **Protocol Security Guarantees (Handled *before* your function is called):**

    1.  **Caller Validation**: The `Receiver Dispatcher` module cryptographically verifies that the caller is a legitimate and authorized CCIP Off-Ramp. This is the most critical check and prevents any unauthorized module from invoking your receiver.

    **Developer Responsibilities (Implemented *within* your `ccip_receive` function):**

    1.  **Source Chain Validation**: You should check the `source_chain_selector` from the message against an allowlist of blockchains you trust.
    2.  **Sender Validation (Optional)**: If your use case requires it, you should check the `sender` address from the message against an allowlist of trusted source accounts.

## Core Components of a CCIP Receiver

A complete CCIP Receiver implementation on Aptos contains several key components.

### Message Structure

Your module must be prepared to handle the `Any2AptosMessage` struct, which it fetches from the `ReceiverRegistry`.

```rust
// From the ccip::client module
struct Any2AptosMessage has store, drop, copy {
    message_id: vector<u8>,
    source_chain_selector: u64,
    sender: vector<u8>,
    data: vector<u8>,
    dest_token_amounts: vector<Any2AptosTokenAmount>
}

struct Any2AptosTokenAmount has store, drop, copy {
    token: address,
    amount: u64
}
```

These structures contain:

- `message_id`: A unique identifier for the message
- `source_chain_selector`: The chain ID of the source chain
- `sender`: The address of the sender on the source chain
- `data`: The arbitrary data payload
- `dest_token_amounts`: An array of tokens and amounts being transferred

### Module State (Resources)

Your module will likely need to store state in on-chain resources. If your module will handle tokens, it's critical to store the `SignerCapability` from its resource account. You also need handles to emit custom events.

```rust
// Example of a state resource from the ccip_message_receiver
struct CCIPReceiverState has key {
    signer_cap: account::SignerCapability,
    received_message_handle: event::EventHandle<ReceivedMessage>,
    forwarded_tokens_handle: event::EventHandle<ForwardedTokens>,
}
```

### The `ccip_receive` Entry Function

This is the core function that implements the CCIP receiver interface. It acts as a secure callback, triggered by the **Receiver Dispatcher** (which is itself called by the CCIP Off-Ramp), and should be designed as a dispatcher to handle different types of incoming messages.

```rust
// A skeleton ccip_receive function
public entry fun ccip_receive<ProofType: drop>(
    _receiver_account: &signer, // The signer of the receiver module's account
    _proof: ProofType,          // A proof object required for the callback mechanism
) acquires State {
    // 1. Fetch the message payload securely from the registry
    let message = receiver_registry::get_receiver_input(signer::address_of(_receiver_account), _proof);

    // 2. Perform security checks (source chain, sender, etc.)
    let source_chain = client::get_source_chain_selector(&message);
    assert!(source_chain == 12345, E_UNAUTHORIZED_CHAIN); // Example check

    // 3. Process the message data
    let received_data = client::get_data(&message);
    if (!received_data.is_empty()) {
        // Your custom data processing logic here
        let state = borrow_global_mut<State>(signer::address_of(_receiver_account));
        state.latest_message = received_data;
    }

    // 4. Process token transfers (if applicable)
    // Note: Tokens are automatically deposited into the receiver's primary store.
    // This logic would be for forwarding or utilizing them.
    let tokens = client::get_dest_token_amounts(&message);
    if (!tokens.is_empty()) {
        // Your custom token handling logic here
    }

    // 5. Emit an event for tracking
    event::emit(MessageReceived {
        message_id: client::get_message_id(&message),
        // ...
    });
}
```

### Administrative Functions

A robust receiver module should include permissioned entry functions for maintenance and security, such as a function to withdraw tokens that may have been sent to it accidentally or for administrative purposes.

```rust
// Example of a permissioned withdrawal function
public entry fun withdraw_token(
    sender: &signer,
    recipient: address,
    token_address: address,
) acquires CCIPReceiverState {
    // Only allow the original deployer to call this function
    assert!(signer::address_of(sender) == @deployer, E_UNAUTHORIZED);

    let state = borrow_global_mut<CCIPReceiverState>(@receiver);
    let state_signer = account::create_signer_with_capability(&state.signer_cap);

    // ... logic to transfer the full balance of a token to the recipient
    fungible_asset::transfer(
        &state_signer,
        // ...
    );
}
```

## Publishing Your Receiver Module

How you publish your module is critical and depends on its purpose.

- **For Data-Only Modules**: If your module only processes data and will never hold assets, you can publish it to a regular user account or code object account (the code object account is recommended).

- **For Token-Handling Modules**: If your module will receive tokens, it **must** be deployed to a **Resource Account**. This gives the module an on-chain `signer` capability, which is required to authorize the transfer of tokens _out_ of its own account. The `createResourceAccountAndPublishReceiver.ts` script in the starter kit handles this process.

## Security Considerations

Building a secure CCIP Receiver on Aptos requires careful attention to several key validation patterns.

### Caller Validation (Protocol Guarantee)

The most critical security check—verifying that the call originates from a legitimate CCIP Off-Ramp—is a **protocol-level guarantee**. This check is performed by the `Receiver Dispatcher` module before your `ccip_receive` function is ever called. It asserts that the caller's signer address is on an allowlist of authorized Off-Ramps, preventing unauthorized modules from sending fake messages to your receiver. Your module's security is built on this foundational guarantee.

### Source Chain and Sender Validation

Your application is responsible for validating the content of the message payload. Inside your `ccip_receive` function, after fetching the `Any2AptosMessage`, you should implement checks against the `source_chain_selector` and `sender` fields if your use case requires it.

```rust
// Inside your ccip_receive function:
let message = receiver_registry::get_receiver_input(...);

// Get the source chain and sender from the message
let source_chain = client::get_source_chain_selector(&message);
let sender_bytes = client::get_sender(&message);

// Verify against your module's allowlists
assert!(is_allowed_source_chain(source_chain), E_UNTRUSTED_SOURCE_CHAIN);
assert!(is_allowed_sender(sender_bytes), E_UNTRUSTED_SENDER);
```

### Message Deduplication

To prevent replay attacks where the same message could be executed multiple times, your receiver should track processed message IDs.

- **Mechanism**: Store recently processed `message_id`s in an on-chain resource (e.g., a `Table` or a `vector`).
- **Implementation**: In your `ccip_receive` function, check if the incoming `message_id` already exists in your store. If it does, abort the transaction. If it doesn't, process the message and then add its ID to the store.

### Asset Management and Account Types

A critical security consideration on Aptos is the account type used for your receiver module.

- To manage (e.g., withdraw or forward) tokens received via CCIP, the receiver module **must** be deployed to a **Resource Account**.
- This provides the necessary on-chain `SignerCapability` for the module to authorize outgoing transactions for the assets it holds.
- Deploying a token-handling module to a standard user or object account will result in **permanently locked funds**, as the module will have no authority to sign for transfers.

## Key Implementation Concepts

### Secure Payload Fetching

As shown in the example, your `ccip_receive` function does not get the message payload in its arguments. It **must** call `receiver_registry::get_receiver_input` to securely fetch the `Any2AptosMessage`. This security pattern ensures that only your registered module can access the payload during a valid CCIP execution.

### Token Handling for Receivers

When tokens are sent to your module, the CCIP Off-Ramp automatically deposits them into your module account's primary fungible store _before_ your `ccip_receive` function is called. To do anything with these tokens (like forward them to another user), your module must be able to sign for the transfer. This is why deploying to a **Resource Account** and using its `SignerCapability` is mandatory for any module that acts as a custodian of assets.

### The Dispatcher Pattern

The `ReceiverRegistry` maps one account address to one `ccip_receive` function. To handle multiple types of actions, use the **dispatcher pattern** within your `ccip_receive` function. By inspecting the `data` and `token_amounts` fields, you can route the logic to different internal functions, allowing a single, secure entry point to manage many functionalities.

## Example Implementation

For a complete reference implementation of a CCIP Receiver on Aptos, you can examine the `ccip_message_receiver` module within the **[Aptos Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/aptos-starter-kit)**. This example demonstrates many of the security patterns and best practices covered in this guide and serves as an excellent starting point for your own implementation.
