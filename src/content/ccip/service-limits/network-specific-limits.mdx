This page describes known network-specific limitations that may result from the design of a particular network. End users, application developers, blockchain development teams, token developers and others should read and understand these risks when considering interacting with these networks on CCIP.

## HyperEVM

**Risk**:
[Hyperliquid Data availability](/ccip/service-responsibility#blockchain-development-team-responsibilities): If a HyperEVM RPC is out of sync or offline for 10+ minutes, missing logs from during the downtime are only available through a centralized resource that is hosted and maintained by Hyperliquid. In the event that logs related to specific CCIP messages are irrecoverable, those CCIP messages can become stuck or fail.

**CCIP Mitigation**:
Hyperliquid has provided a workaround to serve logs through a [dedicated resource](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/raw-hyperevm-block-data) in case their network is inaccessible from RPC providers. CCIP is utilizing Hyperliquid's data source to backfill missing logs. In addition, CCIP Node Operators have implemented additional defense, using an multi-RPC approach, allowing for detection of out-of-sync or offline RPCs and an automatic fallback. If all configured RPCs are unavailable for a period of 10+ minutes AND the Hyperliquid data source does not provide them, logs may not be recoverable.
