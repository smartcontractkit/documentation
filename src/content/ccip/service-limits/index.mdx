This section outlines the operational limits for Chainlink CCIP across different blockchain architectures.

- **[EVM Service Limits](/ccip/service-limits/evm)**: Service limits for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.
- **[SVM Service Limits](/ccip/service-limits/svm)**: Service limits for Solana and other SVM-based blockchains.
- **[Network-Specific Limits](/ccip/service-limits/network-specific-limits)**: Documented network-specific limitations (all blockchain families).

Understanding these limits is essential for building reliable cross-chain applications that operate within CCIP's intended parameters.
