Chainlink Data Feeds are the quickest way to access market prices for real-world assets. This guide demonstrates how to read Chainlink Data Feeds on the Solana Devnet using offchain examples in the [Chainlink Solana Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit). To learn how to use Data Feeds in your onchain Solana programs, see the [Using Data Feeds onchain](/data-feeds/solana/using-data-feeds-solana) guide.

To get the full list of Chainlink Data Feeds on Solana, see the [Solana Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=solana) page.

## The Chainlink Data Feeds Store Program

The program that contains the logic required for the storing and retrieval of Chainlink Data Feeds data on both Devnet and Mainnet is [cjg3oHmg9uuPsP8D6g29NWvhySJkdYdAo9D25PRbKXJ](https://solscan.io/account/cjg3oHmg9uuPsP8D6g29NWvhySJkdYdAo9D25PRbKXJ?cluster=devnet). This is the program ID that you use to read price data from offchain. You can find the source code for this program in the [smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana/tree/develop/contracts/programs/store/src) on GitHub.

You can [add data feeds to an existing offchain project](#adding-data-feeds-to-an-existing-offchain-project) or [use the Solana Starter Kit](#using-the-solana-starter-kit).

## Adding Data Feeds to an existing offchain project

You can read Chainlink Data Feeds offchain in your existing project by using the [Chainlink Solana NPM library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/solana-sdk).

<Aside type="caution" title="Reading feed data">

Although you can directly query the data feed accounts, you should not rely on the memory layout always being the same as it currently is. Based on this, the recommendation is to always use the consumer library.

</Aside>

Install the necessary components and include the example code in your project. Optionally, you can run the example code by itself to learn how it works before you integrate it with your project.

1.  Install the latest Mainnet version of [the Solana CLI](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) and export the path to the CLI:

    ```shell
    sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.13.6/install)" &&
    export PATH="~/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    Run `solana --version` to make sure the Solana CLI is installed correctly.

    ```shell
    solana --version
    ```

1.  Install [Node.js 14 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run `node --version` to verify which version you have installed:

    ```shell
    node --version
    ```

1.  Change to your project directory or create a new directory.

    ```shell
    mkdir off-chain-project && cd off-chain-project
    ```

1.  Optionally [install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to use as a package manager and initialize yarn if your project does not already have a `package.json` file:

    ```shell
    npm install -g yarn && yarn init
    ```

1.  Add the [Anchor library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@project-serum/anchor) to your project:

    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell yarn
    yarn add @project-serum/anchor
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell npm
    npm i @project-serum/anchor
    ```
    </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

1.  Add the [Chainlink Solana NPM library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/solana-sdk) to your project:

    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell yarn
    yarn add @chainlink/solana-sdk
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell npm
    npm i -g @chainlink/solana-sdk
    ```
    </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

1.  [Create a temporary Solana wallet](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#create-wallet) to use for this example. Alternatively, if you have an existing wallet that you want to use, locate the path to your keypair file and use it as the keypair for the rest of this guide.

    ```shell
    solana-keygen new --outfile ./id.json
    ```

1.  Set the [Anchor environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/how-to-set-environment-variables-html). Anchor uses these to determine which wallet to use and how to get a connection to a Solana cluster. Because this example does not generate or sign any transactions, no lamports are required. The wallet is required only by the Anchor library. For a list of available networks and endpoints, see the [Solana Cluster RPC Endpoints](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints) documentation.

    ```shell
    export ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com &&
    export ANCHOR_WALLET=./id.json
    ```

1.  Copy the sample code into your project. This example queries price data offchain. By default, the script reads the SOL/USD feed, but you can change the `CHAINLINK_FEED_ADDRESS` variable to point to the [feed account addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=solana) that you want to query. You can take the components of these code samples and integrate them with your existing project. Because these examples read data feeds without making any onchain changes, no lamports are required to run them.

    <CodeSample src="samples/Solana/PriceFeeds/off-chain-read.js" />

    <CodeSample src="samples/Solana/PriceFeeds/off-chain-read.ts" />

    You can run these examples using the following commands:

    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    <Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.js">Javascript</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.ts">Typescript</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="panel.js">
    ```shell javascript
    node javascript-example.js
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="panel.ts">
    ```shell typescript
    yarn add ts-node typescript && yarn ts-node typescript-example.ts
    ```
    </Fragment>
    </Tabs>

To learn more about Solana and Anchor, see the [Solana Documentation](https://docs.solana.com/) and the [Anchor Documentation](https://book.anchor-lang.com/).

## Using the Solana Starter Kit

This example reads price data from an offchain client using the [Solana Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit).

### Install the required tools

Before you begin, set up your environment for development on Solana:

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if it is not already configured on your system.

1. Install the latest Mainnet version of [the Solana CLI](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) and export the path to the CLI:

   ```shell
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.13.6/install)" &&
   export PATH="~/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   Run `solana --version` to make sure the Solana CLI is installed correctly.

   ```shell
   solana --version
   ```

1. Install [Node.js 14 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run `node --version` to verify which version you have installed:

   ```shell
   node --version
   ```

1. [Install Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation). On some operating systems, you might need to build and install Anchor locally. See the [Anchor documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs) for instructions.

1. Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to simplify package management and run code samples in the Starter Kit.

   ```shell
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

### Run the example program

After you install the required tools, clone the example code from the [solana-starter-kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit) repository.

1. In a terminal, clone the [solana-starter-kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit) repository and change to the `solana-starter-kit` directory:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit &&
   cd ./solana-starter-kit
   ```

   You can see the complete code for the example on [GitHub](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit/).

1. In the `./solana-starter-kit` directory, install Node.js dependencies defined in the `package.json` file:

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

1. Create a temporary Solana wallet file to use for this example. Because your application runs offchain and does not run any functions or alter data onchain, the wallet does not require any SOL tokens to function.

   ```shell
   solana-keygen new --outfile ./id.json
   ```

1. Set the [Anchor environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/how-to-set-environment-variables-html). Anchor uses these to determine which wallet to use and Solana cluster to use. Take note that because we are not generating or signing any transactions, the wallet isn't used, it's just required by the Anchor library. For a list of available networks and endpoints, see the [Solana Cluster RPC Endpoints](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints) documentation.

   ```shell Solana Devnet
   export ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com &&
   export ANCHOR_WALLET=./id.json
   ```

1. Run the example:

   {/* prettier-ignore */}
   <Tabs client:visible>
     <Fragment slot="tab.js">Javascript</Fragment>
     <Fragment slot="tab.ts">Typescript</Fragment>
     <Fragment slot="panel.js">
     ```shell JavaScript
     node read-data.js
     ```
     </Fragment>
     <Fragment slot="panel.ts">
     ```shell TypeScript
     yarn run read-data
     ```
     </Fragment>
   </Tabs>

   The example code retrieves and prints the current price feed data until you close the application:

   ```
   4027000000
   4026439929
   4026476542
   4023000000
   ```
