## Provider-specific considerations

Each provider may implement tokenized equity feeds differently based on their token design and corporate action handling requirements. Review the provider-specific documentation and contact Chainlink Labs at [chainlink_data_feeds@smartcontract.com](mailto:chainlink_data_feeds@smartcontract.com) before integrating their tokenized equity feeds into your protocol.
