The most common use case for Data Feeds is to [Get the Latest Data](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds) from a feed. However, the [AggregatorV3Interface.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) also has functions to retrieve data of a previous round IDs.

There are two parameters that can cause Chainlink nodes to update:

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deviation Threshold | Chainlink nodes are monitoring data offchain. The deviation of the real-world data beyond a certain interval triggers all the nodes to update. |
| Heartbeat Threshold | If the data values stay within the deviation parameters, it will only trigger an update every _X_ minutes / hours.                             |

You can find these parameters at [data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link/) on an example like [ETH / USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd).

To learn how data feeds update, see the [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model?parent=dataFeeds#aggregator) page.

## Historical rounds

As shown in the [decentralized model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model), the consumer contracts call the proxy contract, which abstracts the underlying aggregator contract. The main advantage is to enable upgrades of the aggregator without impacting the consumer contracts. That also means that historical data can can be stored in different aggregators.

As shown in the following sequence diagram, to get historical data, call the `getRoundData` [function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#getrounddata) and provide `roundId` as a parameter.

Note that roundIds have different meanings in proxy contracts and in aggregator contracts.

### `roundId` in Aggregator (aggregatorRoundId)

Oracles provide periodic data updates to the aggregators. Data feeds are updated in **rounds**. Rounds are identified by their `roundId`, which increases with each new round. This increase may not be monotonic. Knowing the `roundId` of a previous round allows contracts to consume historical data.

The examples in this document name the aggregator `roundId` as `aggregatorRoundId` to differentiate it from the proxy `roundId`.

### `roundId` in proxy

Because a proxy has references to current and all previous underlying aggregators, it needs a way to fetch data from the correct aggregator. The `roundId` is computed in the [proxy contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.6/AggregatorProxy.sol) as shown in the following example:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
return uint80(uint256(_phase) << PHASE_OFFSET | _originalId);
```

where:

- `_phase` is incremented each time the underlying aggregator implementation is updated. It is used as a key to find the aggregator address.
- `_originalId` is the aggregator `roundId`. The ID starts at 1.

From the above formula, you can think of it as returning a large number containing the `phase` and the aggregator `roundId`.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  The example formula above ensures that no matter how many times the underlying aggregator changes, the proxy `roundId`
  will always increase.
</Aside>

**Example:**

When you query historical data, it is important to know when you reach the end of the history of the underlying aggregator. As an example, if the [`latestRoundData` function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#latestrounddata) of the [LINK / USD Price Feed on Ethereum Mainnet](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=ethereum) returns `roundId = 92233720368547771158`, you can use this value to compute the `phaseId` and `aggregatorRoundId`:

- `phaseId = 92233720368547771158 >> 64`: Right shifting an integer by 64 bits is equivalent to dividing it by 2^64: `phaseId = 92233720368547771158/ 2^64 = 5`. The current phase id is 5 , which means that this proxy has had 5 underlying aggregators since its initial deployment.
- `aggregatorRoundId = uint64(92233720368547771158)`: This retrieves the first 64 bits from the right. To calculate this offchain, you can use the following JavaScript example:

```javascript
// First parse to BigInt to perform computation with big integers
const num = BigInt("92233720368547771158")
const num2 = BigInt("0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF") // Largest 64bits integer

console.log(Number(num >> 64n)) // returns 5 (phaseId)
console.log(Number(num & num2)) // returns 13078 (aggregatorRoundId) . Use & (AND bitwise operator) which sets each bit to _1_ if both bits are _1_
```

Using _13078_ as the current aggregator's round, get its historical data by looping over the [`getRoundData` function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#getrounddata):

- Start from the first round: _92233720368547758081_ (result of _92233720368547771158 - 13078 + 1_)
- Continue until the current round: _92233720368547771158_

To get the historical data for previous aggregators, decrement the `phaseId` and start from round _1_. For phase _4_, get the starting `roundId` offchain using the following JavaScript example:

```javascript
const phaseId = BigInt("4")
const aggregatorRoundId = BigInt("1")

roundId = (phaseId << 64n) | aggregatorRoundId // returns 73786976294838206465n
```

Loop over the [`getRoundData` function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#getrounddata). Start at _73786976294838206465_ and increment it until you get a revert. This means that you reached the last round for the underlying aggregator. The same process could be repeated for previous `phaseIds` (3,2,1).

<Aside type="caution" title="Looping onchain">
  The examples showed how to loop offchain to fetch all historical data from a given proxy. You could also write a
  similar code onchain, but be aware that this could cause **very high gas prices** if a state is changed within the
  same function.
</Aside>

### `getRoundData` return values

The [`getRoundData` function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#getrounddata) returns the following values:

- `roundId`: The round in which the answer was updated
- `answer`: The answer reflects the data recorded for the specified round
- `answeredInRound`: <Icon type="deprecated" /> Deprecated - Previously used when answers could take multiple rounds to be computed
- `startedAt`: The timestamp when the round started
- `updatedAt`: The timestamp when the answer was computed
