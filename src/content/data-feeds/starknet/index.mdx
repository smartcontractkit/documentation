Starknet is a permissionless decentralized Zk-rollup operating as an L2 network over Ethereum. Unlike other Ethereum L2 networks, Starknet is not EVM-compatible and uses [Cairo](https://docs.cairo-lang.org/index.html) as its smart contract language. Chainlink Data Feeds are available on Starknet Sepolia as Cairo smart contracts.

### Offchain examples

You can read Chainlink Data Feeds offchain without a Starknet account. Complete these steps using only the [Starkli CLI](#getting-started-starkli-cli) or the [Starknet Foundry](/data-feeds/starknet/tutorials/snfoundry/read-data) toolkit.

### Onchain examples

You can read Chainlink Data Feeds on Starknet Sepolia using an [onchain contract](/data-feeds/starknet/tutorials/snfoundry/consumer-contract) that you compile, declare, and deploy using [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry).

### Devnet examples

Experiment with Chainlink Data Feeds on Starknet using [Starknet Devnet RS](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs), a local Docker-based testnet environment implemented using Rust.
The [Starknet Devnet RS guide](/data-feeds/starknet/tutorials/snfoundry/sn-devnet-rs) provides code examples and scripts that enable you to compile, declare, and deploy your own aggregator and consumer contracts. You can use a set of pre-funded accounts to interact with Chainlink Data Feeds on Starknet without deploying to a live network.

## Getting Started (Starkli CLI)

[Starkli](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli) is a Starknet standalone CLI similar to [cairo-lang](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang), but it is written in Rust. It enables interaction with a Starknet network without the need for extra tools or dependencies.

In this example, you will use the `starkli call` command to read data from a Chainlink Price Feed on Starknet Sepolia. This command requires the proxy aggregator address, the function selector, and an RPC endpoint for Starknet Sepolia.

### Requirements

Make sure you have the Starkli CLI installed. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="starkli --version" code/> in your terminal. Expect an output similar to the following:

```bash
starkli --version
0.2.8 (f59724e)
```

Follow the official [installation guide](<(https://book.starkli.rs/installation)>) if necessary.

### Read data from a Chainlink Price Feed

Use the following command to call the `latest_round_data` function on the ETH / USD Chainlink Price Feed aggregator proxy:

```bash
starkli call \
0x228128e84cdfc51003505dd5733729e57f7d1f7e54da679474e73db4ecaad44 \
latest_round_data \
--rpc https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_7
```

Expect an output similar to the following:

```bash
[
    "0x000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000320c",
    "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005293770eb1",
    "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d44d",
    "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006606b8cc",
    "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006606b8a2"
]
```

The example output contains an array with the hex-encoded latest round data for the ETH / USD Chainlink Price Feed on Starknet Sepolia. The array contains the following values:

| Value name   | Hex-encoded value                                                    | Decoded value                             | Description                                                                                                      |

Note: This example uses a [Blast API](https://blastapi.io/public-api/starknet) RPC endpoint. You can interact with the network using any other Starknet Sepolia RPC provider, such as [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/starknet) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/networks/ethereum/starknet).
