import { CodeSample, CopyText } from "@components"

This example uses a local OpenZeppelin account to deploy and interact with a consumer contract onchain. This contract retrieves data from a specified Chainlink data feed on Starknet Sepolia and stores the information for the latest round of data.

## Requirements

### Set up your environment

This guide uses the [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) toolkit and the [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) project management tool so you can compile, deploy, and interact with your Starknet smart contracts.

- **Starknet Foundry**: Install Starknet Foundry **v0.21.0**. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="snforge --version" code/> or <CopyText text="sncast --version" code/> in your terminal and [install the required version](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry#installation) if necessary.

- **Scarb**: Install Scarb **v2.6.4**. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="scarb --version" code/> in your terminal and [install the required version](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-installation-script) if necessary.

Alternatively, you can use the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/introduction.html) tool version manager to install both Starknet Foundry and Scarb. Read the setup instructions for [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/asdf-starknet-foundry) and [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf) for more information.

### Clone and configure the code examples repository

1. Clone the [chainlink-starknet](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/) repository, which includes the example contracts for this guide:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the `aggregator_consumer` directory:

   ```bash
   cd chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/
   ```

After you prepare the requirements, make sure the required tools are configured correctly by running the tests:

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

The contracts should compile successfully and the tests should pass.

## Tutorial

### Create, deploy, and fund an account

1. Run the [`create-account`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/c97baa6e52c7e6e01ea0235bf0e71abae23e3c00/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/Makefile#L22) script to create a new OpenZeppelin local account for the Sepolia testnet:

   ```bash
   make create-account
   ```

   The account details are stored locally in your `~/.starknet_accounts/starknet_open_zeppelin_accounts.json` file.

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   command: account create
   address: 0x3e7ee3d05d3efae4e493c9733c8c391d4a5cc63d34f95a164c832060fcdd43d
   max_fee: 9529927566560
   message: Account successfully created. Prefund generated address with at least <max_fee> tokens. It is good to send more in the case of higher demand.

   Your accounts:
   {
     "alpha-sepolia": {
       "testnet-account": {
         "address": "0x3e7ee3d05d3efae4e493c9733c8c391d4a5cc63d34f95a164c832060fcdd43d",
         "class_hash": "0x4c6d6cf894f8bc96bb9c525e6853e5483177841f7388f74a46cfda6f028c755",
         "deployed": false,
         "legacy": false,
         "private_key": <PRIVATE_KEY>,
         "public_key": "0x2972c3cb7aa85403fa1e038f9ce7a93f025ea57017eb7ef735bae989bfb15bd",
         "salt": "0x61a062d2dd4e7656"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   From the output, note:

   - Your account address. In this example, it is `0x03e7ee3d05d3efae4e493c9733c8c391d4a5cc63d34f95a164c832060fcdd43d`, with an added zero after `0x`.
   - The `max_fee` value, which is the minimum amount of testnet ETH required to deploy the account.

1. Fund the newly created account with testnet ETH to cover the account deployment, the consumer contract deployment, and the network interaction costs.

   Go to the Blast [Starknet Sepolia ETH Faucet](https://blastapi.io/faucets/starknet-sepolia-eth) and enter your account address to receive testnet ETH. Wait a few seconds for the transaction to complete.

   Alternatively, you can transfer ETH tokens from a Starknet-compatible wallet, such as [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Braavos](https://braavos.app/), or use the [StarkGate bridge](https://starkgate.starknet.io/) to transfer testnet ETH from Ethereum Sepolia to Starknet Sepolia. If you need testnet ETH on Ethereum Sepolia, you can use the [Chainlink faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).

1. Deploy your account to Starknet Sepolia:

   ```bash
   make deploy-account
   ```

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   command: account deploy
   transaction_hash: 0x541ffae49f77dd942376391286052d9fb87dc8d6848139ab1508c114e3aa005
   ```

   Wait a few seconds for the transaction to complete.

### Deploy and interact with a consumer contract

The consumer contract contains two functions that you interact with in this example:

- `set_answer` retrieves the latest `answer` from the specified aggregator contract and stores it in the `_answer` internal storage variable.
- `read_answer` reads the stored `_answer` value.

1. Navigate to `/scripts/src/consumer/` and open the [`deploy_aggregator_consumer`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/consumer/deploy_aggregator_consumer.cairo) script.

1. Update the `aggregator_address` variable within the `main` function with the ETH / USD Chainlink proxy aggregator contract address on Starknet Sepolia : <CopyText text="0x228128e84cdfc51003505dd5733729e57f7d1f7e54da679474e73db4ecaad44" code/>.

1. Run the [`deploy_aggregator_consumer`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/consumer/deploy_aggregator_consumer.cairo) script to deploy a consumer contract to Starknet Sepolia. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   make ac-deploy NETWORK=testnet
   ```

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Declaring and deploying AggregatorConsumer
   Declaring contract...

   Transaction hash = 0x46b39d79cf90ed75fbae5d097d6026cf7ab1184e852d36aed336528fc77220d
   Waiting for transaction to be accepted (59 retries / 295s left until timeout)

   AggregatorConsumer deployed at address: 2956260449156927152048242588422796467290585049226993045191257886158889626959

   command: script run
   status: success
   ```

   The consumer address is represented in its decimal form: `2956260449156927152048242588422796467290585049226993045191257886158889626959`. You can use a [converter tool](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) to get the hexadecimal format. In this example, the hexadecimal equivalent is `0x06892f22691473dc5a413a7626062604155516ec91a82d3734dc68bcf3d72d4f`. Save your consumer address for the next steps.

1. In `/scripts/src/consumer/`, open the [`set_answer`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/consumer/set_answer.cairo) script and update the `consumer_address` variable with your deployed consumer address.

1. Run the following command to update the answer:

   ```bash
   make ac-set-answer NETWORK=testnet
   ```

   This command runs the [`set_answer`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/consumer/set_answer.cairo) script to retrieve the latest `answer` from the ETH / USD aggregator contract and stores it in the internal storage variable `_answer` of your consumer contract.

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Result::Ok(CallResult { data: [3374557091160001179079409876363576078229871685244120671563970051729036896526] })
   Result::Ok(CallResult { data: [340282366920938463463374607431768224268, 354661371569, 54349, 1711716556, 1711716514] })
   Transaction hash = 0x20edd6388041d78a36f153a7694fd8c0849d81aff3fc2d5a0606d7275ea4837
   Waiting for transaction to be accepted (59 retries / 295s left until timeout)
   Result::Ok(InvokeResult { transaction_hash: 930889525374955449815155593419397099236202282693723934594292211164864202807 })
   command: script run
   status: success
   ```

1. In `/scripts/src/consumer/`, open the [`read_answer`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/consumer/read_answer.cairo) script and update the `consumer_address` variable with your deployed consumer address.

1. Run the following command to read the stored `answer` value from your consumer contract:

   ```bash
   make ac-read-answer NETWORK=testnet
   ```

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Result::Ok(CallResult { data: [354661371569] })
   command: script run
   status: success
   ```

   The answer on the ETH / USD feed uses 8 decimal places, so an answer of `354661371569` indicates an ETH / USD price of `3546.61371569`. Each feed uses a different number of decimal places for answers. You can find the correct number of decimal places on the [Price Feed addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=starknet) page by clicking the Show more details checkbox.
