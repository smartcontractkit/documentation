This guide employs [Starknet Devnet RS](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs), a local Docker-based testnet environment for Starknet. It provides code examples, [scripts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/tree/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src), and [commands](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/Makefile) that enable you to deploy and experiment with your own aggregator and consumer contracts. You can use a set of prefunded accounts to interact with Chainlink Data Feeds on Starknet without deploying to a live network.

## Requirements

### Set up your environment

This guide uses the [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) toolkit and the [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) project management tool so you can compile, deploy, and interact with your Starknet smart contracts.

- **Starknet Foundry**: Install Starknet Foundry **v0.21.0**. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="snforge --version" code/> or <CopyText text="sncast --version" code/> in your terminal and [install the required version](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry#installation) if necessary.

- **Scarb**: Install Scarb **v2.6.4**. You can check your current version by running <CopyText text="scarb --version" code/> in your terminal and [install the required version](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-installation-script) if necessary.

Alternatively, you can use the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/introduction.html) tool version manager to install both Starknet Foundry and Scarb. Read the setup instructions for [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/asdf-starknet-foundry) and [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf) for more information.

- **Docker**: Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You will run Starknet Devnet RS in a Docker container.

### Clone and configure the code examples repository

1. Clone the [chainlink-starknet](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/) repository, which includes the example contracts for this guide:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the `aggregator_consumer` directory:

   ```bash
   cd chainlink-starknet/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/
   ```

1. Open your `snfoundry.toml` file and locate the `[sncast.devnet]` section. Make sure the `url` points to the correct endpoint for connecting to the Starknet node running inside the Docker container. By default, it is:

   ```bash
   [sncast.default]
   url = "http://127.0.0.1:5050/rpc"
   ```

After you prepare the requirements, check to make sure the required tools are configured correctly by running the tests:

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

The contracts should compile successfully and the tests should pass.

## Tutorial

<Aside type="note" title="Contract addresses for Starknet Devnet RS">
  If you followed the [onchain](/data-feeds/starknet/tutorials/snfoundry/consumer-contract) guide, [clone the
  chainlink-starknet
  repository](/data-feeds/starknet/tutorials/snfoundry/sn-devnet-rs#clone-and-configure-the-code-examples-repository)
  again to make sure you start from a clean state. By default, some addresses used in this guide are hardcoded to work
  with the Starknet Devnet RS environment.
</Aside>

### Run Starknet Devnet RS and add a prefunded account

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running.

1. Execute the following command to run a Starknet Devnet RS container:

   ```bash
   make devnet
   ```

   Note: Executing this command when a container is running stops and recreates the container, which helps restart from a clean state.

1. The Starknet devnet container includes a set of prefunded accounts. To execute the scripts from this guide, add one of these accounts to a local `accounts.json` file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   make add-account
   ```

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Importing a prefunded account from starknet devnet container...

   command: account add

   Your accounts:

   {
   "alpha-goerli": {
      "devnet-account": {
         "address": "0x4b3f4ba8c00a02b66142a4b1dd41a4dfab4f92650922a3280977b0f03c75ee1",
         "class_hash": "0x61dac032f228abef9c6626f995015233097ae253a7f72d68552db02f2971b8f",
         "deployed": true,
         "legacy": false,
         "private_key": "0x57b2f8431c772e647712ae93cc616638",
         "public_key": "0x374f7fcb50bc2d6b8b7a267f919232e3ac68354ce3eafe88d3df323fc1deb23"
      }
   }
   }
   ```

### Deploy and interact with a mock aggregator contract

1. Declare and deploy a mock aggregator contract to the devnet by using the [`deploy_mock_aggregator`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/mock_aggregator/deploy_mock_aggregator.cairo) script. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   make ma-deploy NETWORK=devnet
   ```

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Declaring and deploying MockAggregator
   Declaring contract...
   Transaction hash = 0x1d4cb925322e0f9645cf0bf4028b7fca963b5325cc685784c0f6e22628de8ad
   Class hash = 3238358970964595466962588940073124312643094641461979698784985925711454737896

   Transaction hash = 0x6b065766a26105fbd9bf55be46675d2c2b4b0dd9a85db5ab0b6a1f8ad04f743
   MockAggregator deployed at address: 1708487128334545444076626254389547159540422020354796381590079145465639129383

   command: script run
   status: success
   ```

1. Read the latest round of data by using the [`read_latest_round`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/aggregator/read_latest_round.cairo) script. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   make agg-read-latest-round NETWORK=devnet
   ```

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Result::Ok(CallResult { data: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] })
   command: script run
   status: success
   ```

   The default data on the mock aggregator contract is all set to zeros.

1. Set the latest round of data to values defined in the [`set_latest_round`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/mock_aggregator/set_latest_round.cairo) script. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   make ma-set-latest-round NETWORK=devnet
   ```

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Transaction hash = 0x3f01f4595dcf20b4f355720540d5279efc0fff306d4e848dda4550cdd2a5367
   Result::Ok(InvokeResult { transaction_hash: 1781197671452105104356220458359085564429259248315865550090042149835146679143 })
   command: script run
   status: success
   ```

1. Read the latest round of data again to verify the updated values:

   ```bash
   make agg-read-latest-round NETWORK=devnet
   ```

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Result::Ok(CallResult { data: [1, 1, 12345, 1711716556, 1711716514] })
   command: script run
   status: success
   ```

### Deploy and interact with a mock aggregator and a mock consumer contract

The mock aggregator consumer contract is initialized with the address of an aggregator mock contract during the contract's constructor call and contains two functions:

- `set_answer` retrieves the latest `answer` from the specified aggregator contract and stores it in the internal storage variable `_answer`.
- `read_answer` reads the stored `_answer` value.

1. Run the following command to (re)start the Starknet Devnet RS container:

   ```bash
   make devnet
   ```

1. If you haven't already, add a prefunded account to the local `accounts.json` file using the following command:

   ```bash
   make add-account
   ```

1. Declare and deploy both a mock aggregator and a consumer contracts to the devnet by running the following command:

   ```bash
   make devnet-deploy
   ```

   This command executes both [`deploy_mock_aggregator`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/mock_aggregator/deploy_mock_aggregator.cairo) and [`deploy_aggregator_consumer`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src/consumer/deploy_aggregator_consumer.cairo) scripts.

   Expect an output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Declaring and deploying MockAggregator
   Declaring contract...
   Transaction hash = 0x568d29d07128cba750845b57a4bb77a31f628b6f4288861d8b31d12e71e4c3b

   AggregatorConsumer deployed at address: 2775662320989421053891107164335108610292525354452508848326323790006553228656

   command: script run
   status: success
   ```

Once the contracts are deployed, experiment with both contracts and the available [scripts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/tree/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/scripts/src) and [commands](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/develop/examples/contracts/aggregator_consumer/Makefile) as needed for your projects.

For instance, you can set new values for the latest round of data on the aggregator contract, retrieve and set the `answer` on the consumer contract, and read the `answer` from the consumer contract:

```bash
make ma-set-latest-round NETWORK=devnet && make ac-set-answer NETWORK=devnet && make ac-read-answer NETWORK=devnet
```
