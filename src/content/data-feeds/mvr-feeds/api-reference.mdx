import { Aside, Icon } from "@components"

When you use MVR Feeds, you typically retrieve the data through the `IBundleAggregatorProxy` interface and the proxy contract address. This interface combines functions from both `IBundleBaseAggregator` and `ICommonAggregator`. If the aggregator behind the proxy changes, your consumer contract remains compatible as long as you interact through the proxy interface.

To see detailed examples of how to integrate these functions, refer to the [Using MVR Feeds on EVM Chains (Solidity)](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/guides/evm-solidity) guide.

## IBundleAggregatorProxy

`IBundleAggregatorProxy` extends both `IBundleBaseAggregator` and `ICommonAggregator`. In addition, it provides functions to manage or view the underlying aggregator reference.

A minimal example showing how to set the proxy address and call these functions in your consumer contract:

```solidity
import { IBundleAggregatorProxy } from "./interfaces/IBundleAggregatorProxy.sol";

contract MyMVRConsumer {
    IBundleAggregatorProxy public proxy;

    constructor(address _proxyAddress) {
    proxy = IBundleAggregatorProxy(_proxyAddress);
    }

    function readLatestData() external view returns (bytes memory, uint256) {
    // Retrieve the latest bundle as raw bytes
    bytes memory bundle = proxy.latestBundle();
    // Get the timestamp of the latest update
    uint256 timestamp = proxy.latestBundleTimestamp();
    return (bundle, timestamp);
    }
}
```

| [confirmAggregator](#confirmaggregator)         | Confirms a new aggregator address. Typically, only the owner or an authorized entity can call this.              |
| [aggregator](#aggregator)                       | Returns the address of the currently confirmed aggregator behind the proxy.                                      |
| [latestBundle](#latestbundle)                   | Returns the most recent data bundle as a bytes array.                                                            |
| [bundleDecimals](#bundledecimals)               | Returns an array of decimals that match each numeric field in the bundle. Non-numeric fields typically have 0.   |
| [latestBundleTimestamp](#latestbundletimestamp) | Returns the timestamp of the most recent data bundle.                                                            |
| [description](#description)                     | A short description of the underlying aggregator or feed.                                                        |
| [version](#version)                             | Returns a version number for the aggregator.                                                                     |

#### proposedAggregator

```solidity
function proposedAggregator() external view returns (address);
```

Returns the address of the aggregator that is proposed to replace the current aggregator. This aggregator is not active until it is confirmed.

#### confirmAggregator

```solidity
function confirmAggregator(address aggregatorAddress) external;
```

Confirms a new aggregator contract address. Only authorized addresses can typically call this function.

- Parameters:
  - aggregatorAddress: The address of the new aggregator to confirm.

#### aggregator

```solidity
function aggregator() external view returns (address);
```

Returns the address of the currently confirmed aggregator behind the proxy.

#### latestBundle

```solidity
function latestBundle() external view returns (bytes memory bundle);
```

Returns the most recent data bundle as a bytes array. You can decode this bundle according to the known structure for your specific MVR feed.

#### bundleDecimals

```solidity
function bundleDecimals() external view returns (uint8[] memory);
```

Returns an array of decimals for the numeric fields of the data bundle. Fields of other types, such as bool, typically have a corresponding decimal value of 0.

#### latestBundleTimestamp

```solidity
function latestBundleTimestamp() external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the timestamp (block time) of the most recent update to the data bundle.

#### description

```solidity
function description() external view returns (string memory);
```

Returns a short description of the underlying aggregator or feed.

#### version

```solidity
function version() external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the version number of the aggregator behind the proxy.

## IBundleBaseAggregator

`IBundleBaseAggregator` defines the core functions for reading multiple-variable data from an onchain aggregator. These functions are inherited by `IBundleAggregatorProxy`.

### Functions in IBundleBaseAggregator

| Name                  | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| latestBundle          | Returns the most recent data bundle as a bytes array.              |
| bundleDecimals        | Returns the array of decimals corresponding to each numeric field. |
| latestBundleTimestamp | Returns the timestamp of the most recent data bundle.              |

#### latestBundle

```solidity
function latestBundle() external view returns (bytes memory bundle);
```

Returns the latest encoded bundle data as a bytes array.

#### bundleDecimals

```solidity
function bundleDecimals() external view returns (uint8[] memory);
```

Returns an array of decimals where each entry corresponds to a numeric field in the bundle. Non-numeric fields might have a value of 0.

#### latestBundleTimestamp

```solidity
function latestBundleTimestamp() external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the block timestamp of the most recent data bundle.

## ICommonAggregator

`ICommonAggregator` provides common metadata functions for aggregator contracts, such as a human-readable description and a version number.
