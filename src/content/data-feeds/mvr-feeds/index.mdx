**Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) feeds** bundle multiple data points into a single onchain update, offering more versatility compared to feeds that store only one numeric value.

Traditional Chainlink Data Feeds typically provide a single numeric value such as a price. By contrast, MVR feeds can return multiple values of different types in a single update, including both numeric and non-numeric data.

## Key Benefits

1. **Multiple Data Points**: Package related data together in one feed. For example, an investment fund feed might include:

   | Field                   | Type      |
   | ----------------------- | --------- |
   | `netAssetValue`         | `uint256` |
   | `assetsUnderManagement` | `uint256` |
   | `outstandingShares`     | `uint256` |
   | `netIncomeExpenses`     | `uint256` |
   | `openToNewInvestors`    | `bool`    |

1. **Extensibility**: The feed structure can be extended or updated without deploying a new contract.

1. **Efficiency**: Multiple data points update in a single transaction.

1. **Flexible Types**: Support for various data types beyond just numbers.

## Reading MVR Feed Data

MVR feeds use the `BundleAggregatorProxy` contract as their interface, which provides three key functions:

- [`latestBundle()`](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/api-reference#latestbundle): Returns the complete data bundle as a bytes array
- [`bundleDecimals()`](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/api-reference#bundledecimals): Returns the decimal places for each numeric field
- [`latestBundleTimestamp()`](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/api-reference#latestbundletimestamp): Returns when the data was last updated

To use these feeds in your smart contracts, you'll need to:

1. Obtain the `BundleAggregatorProxy` address for your desired feed from the [SmartData addresses](/data-feeds/smartdata/addresses) page (use the _Show Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) feeds_ checkbox to filter the list)
1. Retrieve the data using `latestBundle()`
1. Decode the bytes array into the appropriate structure

**Note**: MVR feeds only store the most recent data onchain. If you need historical data, you must capture it within your own contract or through an offchain indexer.
