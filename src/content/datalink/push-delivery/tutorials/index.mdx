Learn how to integrate DataLink push-based feeds into your applications. DataLink feeds use the same interfaces as Chainlink Data Feeds, ensuring a familiar developer experience.

<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">
  These guides represent examples of using a Chainlink product or service and is provided to help you understand how to
  interact with Chainlink's systems and services so that you can integrate them into your own. This template is provided
  "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, has not been audited, and may be missing key checks or
  error handling to make the usage of the product more clear. Do not use the code in this example in a production
  environment without completing your own audits and application of best practices. Neither Chainlink Labs, the
  Chainlink Foundation, nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs that are generated due to
