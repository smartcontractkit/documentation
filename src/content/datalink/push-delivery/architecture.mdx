DataLink (Push Delivery) provides infrastructure for Data Providers to make their specialized data available onchain through direct delivery to smart contracts, leveraging the proven [Chainlink Data Feeds](/data-feeds) architecture.

1. **Data Provider Connection**
   - Chainlink Labs curates and onboards premium Data Providers who make their specialized data available via secure API endpoints
   - The provider makes their proprietary data available via a secure API endpoint.

1. **Data Fetching & Consensus (Data DON)**
   - Multiple nodes within a Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) independently fetch data from the provider's API.
   - Nodes reach consensus on the data received from the provider.

1. **Onchain Delivery**
   - **Automatic Updates**: Aggregated data is automatically pushed onchain to aggregator contracts based on:
     - **Deviation Threshold**: Updates trigger when offchain values deviate beyond a defined threshold from the onchain value
     - **Heartbeat Threshold**: Updates occur after a specified time interval, regardless of price movement
   - **Smart Contract Storage**: Data is stored onchain in aggregator contracts, making it immediately available for smart contract consumption

1. **Consumer Access**
   - **Proxy Architecture**: Consumer contracts access data through proxy contracts that point to the current aggregator
   - **Standard Interface**: Integration uses the familiar [`AggregatorV3Interface`](/datalink/push-delivery/api-reference#aggregatorv3interface) for seamless compatibility
