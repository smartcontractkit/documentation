When you use DataLink feeds, retrieve the feeds through the `AggregatorV3Interface` and the proxy address.

## AggregatorV3Interface

Import this interface to your contract and use it to run functions in the proxy contract. Create the interface object by pointing to the proxy address. For example, you could create the interface object in the constructor of your contract:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
constructor() {
  dataLinkFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(<PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>);
}
```

To see examples for how to use this interface, read the [Using DataLink Feeds](/datalink/push-delivery/tutorials/using-datalink-feeds) guide.

You can see the code for the [`AggregatorV3Interface` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) on GitHub.

### Functions in AggregatorV3Interface

| Name                                | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [decimals](#decimals)               | The number of decimals in the response.                              |
| [description](#description)         | The description of the aggregator that the proxy points to.          |
| [getRoundData](#getrounddata)       | Get data from a specific round.                                      |
| [latestRoundData](#latestrounddata) | Get data from the latest round.                                      |
| [version](#version)                 | The version representing the type of aggregator the proxy points to. |

#### decimals

Get the number of decimals present in the response value.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
```

- `RETURN`: The number of decimals.

#### description

Get the description of the underlying aggregator that the proxy points to.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
function description() external view returns (string memory);
```

- `RETURN`: The description of the underlying aggregator.

#### getRoundData

Get data about a specific round, using the `roundId`.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
function getRoundData(
  uint80 _roundId
) external view returns (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound);
```

**Parameters:**

- `_roundId`: The round ID

**Return values:**

- `roundId`: The round ID
- `answer`: The answer for this round
- `startedAt`: Timestamp of when the round started
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp of when the round was updated
- `answeredInRound`: <Icon type="deprecated" /> Deprecated - Previously used when answers could take multiple rounds to be computed

#### latestRoundData

Get the data from the latest round.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
function latestRoundData() external view
    returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    )
```

**Return values:**

- `roundId`: The round ID.
- `answer`: The data that this specific feed provides. Depending on the feed you selected, this answer provides asset prices, reserves, and other types of data.
- `startedAt`: Timestamp of when the round started.
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp of when the round was updated.
- `answeredInRound`: <Icon type="deprecated" /> Deprecated - Previously used when answers could take multiple rounds to be computed

#### version

The version representing the type of aggregator the proxy points to.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
function version() external view returns (uint256)
```

- `RETURN`: The version number.
