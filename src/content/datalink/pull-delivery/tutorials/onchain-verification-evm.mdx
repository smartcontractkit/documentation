In this guide, you'll learn how to verify onchain the integrity of reports by confirming their authenticity as signed by the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). You'll use a verifier contract to verify the data onchain and pay the verification fee in LINK tokens.

<DataStreams section="asideDisclaimer" />

## Before you begin

Make sure you understand how to fetch reports via the REST API or WebSocket connection. Refer to the following guides for more information:

- [Fetch and decode reports (API) using the Go or Rust SDK](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/fetch-decode/api-go)
- [Stream and decode reports (WebSocket) using the Go or Rust SDK](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/stream-decode/ws-go)

## Requirements

- This guide requires testnet ETH and LINK on _Arbitrum Sepolia_. Both are available at [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia).
- Learn how to [Fund your contract with LINK](/resources/fund-your-contract).

## Tutorial

### Deploy the verifier contract

Deploy a `ClientReportsVerifier` contract on _Arbitrum Sepolia_. This contract is enabled to verify reports and pay the verification fee in LINK tokens.

1. [Open the ClientReportsVerifier.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/DataLink/ClientReportsVerifier.sol) contract in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/DataLink/ClientReportsVerifier.sol" showButtonOnly />

1. Select the `ClientReportsVerifier.sol` contract in the **Solidity Compiler** tab.

   <ClickToZoom

     alt="Chainlink DataLink - Verify Report Data Onchain - Solidity Compiler"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Compile the contract.

1. Open MetaMask and set the network to _Arbitrum Sepolia_. If you need to add Arbitrum Sepolia to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#arbitrum-sepolia-testnet) page.
   - <a
       class="erc-token-address"
       id="421614_0xb1D4538B4571d411F07960EF2838Ce337FE1E80E"
       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#arbitrum-sepolia-testnet"
     >
       Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and LINK token contract
     </a>

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

     alt="Chainlink DataLink - Verify Report Data Onchain - Injected Provider MetaMask"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. In the **Contract** section, select the `ClientReportsVerifier` contract and fill in the Arbitrum Sepolia **verifier proxy address**: <CopyText text="0x2ff010DEbC1297f19579B4246cad07bd24F2488A" code/>. You can find the verifier proxy addresses on the [Verifier Proxy Addresses](/datalink/pull-delivery/verifier-proxy-addresses) page.

     alt="Chainlink DataLink Remix Deploy ClientReportsVerifier Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to ensure you deploy the contract to _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Save this contract address for the next step.

   />

### Fund the verifier contract

In this example, the client contract pays for onchain verification of reports in LINK tokens when fees are required. The contract automatically detects whether the target network requires fees:

- **Networks with `FeeManager` deployed**: Verification requires token payments. These networks include: Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Blast, Bob, Ink, Linea, OP, Scroll, Soneium, and ZKSync.

- **Networks without `FeeManager`**: No funding is needed since you can verify reports without fees. The contract skips the fee calculation and approval steps.

For this tutorial on _Arbitrum Sepolia_, fees are required, so you need to fund the contract with LINK tokens. Open MetaMask and send 1 testnet LINK on _Arbitrum Sepolia_ to the verifier contract address you saved earlier.

### Verify a report onchain

1.  In Remix, on the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, expand your verifier contract under the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1.  Fill in the `verifyReport` function input parameter with the report payload you want to verify. You can use the following full report payload obtained in the [Fetch and decode report via a REST API](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/fetch-decode/api-go) guide (EUR/USD feed) as an example:

        ```
        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

1.  Click the `verifyReport` button to call the function. MetaMask prompts you to accept the transaction.

1.  Click the `lastDecodedPrice` getter function to view the decoded price from the verified report. The answer on the EUR/USD stream uses 18 decimal places, so an answer of `1137900000000000100` indicates an EUR/USD price of 1.1379000000000001. **Note**: Each feed may use a different number of decimal places for answers.

## Examine the code

The example code you deployed has all the interfaces and functions required to verify DataLink reports onchain.

<CodeSample src="samples/DataLink/ClientReportsVerifier.sol" />

### Initializing the contract

When deploying the contract, you define the verifier proxy address for the feed you want to read from. You can find this address on the [Verifier Proxy Addresses](/datalink/pull-delivery/verifier-proxy-addresses) page. The verifier proxy address provides functions that are required for this example:

- The `s_feeManager` function to estimate the verification fees.
- The `verify` function to verify the report onchain.

### Verifying a report

The `verifyReport` function is the core function that handles onchain report verification. Here's how it works:

- **Report data extraction**:
  - The function decodes the `unverifiedReport` to extract the report data.
  - It then extracts the report version by reading the first two bytes of the report data, which correspond to the schema version encoded in the feed ID.
  - If the report version is unsupported, the function reverts with an InvalidReportVersion error.

- **Fee calculation and handling**:
  - The function first checks if a `FeeManager` contract exists by querying `s_feeManager()` on the verifier proxy.
  - **If a `FeeManager` exists** (non-zero address):
    - It calculates the fees required for verification using the `getFeeAndReward` function.
    - It approves the `RewardManager` contract to spend the calculated amount of LINK tokens from the contract's balance.
    - It encodes the fee token address into the `parameterPayload` for the verification call.
    - `FeeManager` contracts are currently deployed on: Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Blast, Bob, Ink, Linea, OP, Scroll, Soneium, and ZKSync.
  - **If no `FeeManager` exists** (zero address):
    - The function skips the fee calculation and approval steps entirely.
    - It passes an empty `parameterPayload` to the verification call.
  - This automatic detection makes the contract compatible with any network, regardless of whether fee management is deployed.

- **Report verification**:
  - The `verify` function of the verifier proxy is called to perform the actual verification.
  - It passes the `unverifiedReport` and the `parameterPayload` (which contains either the encoded fee token address or empty bytes) as parameters.

- **Data decoding**:
  - Depending on the report version, the function decodes the verified report data into the appropriate struct (`ReportV3` or `ReportV4`).
  - It emits a `DecodedPrice` event with the price extracted from the verified report.
  - The `lastDecodedPrice` state variable is updated with the new price.

### Additional functionality

The contract also includes:

- **Owner-only token withdrawal**: The `withdrawToken` function allows the contract owner to withdraw any ERC-20 tokens (including LINK) from the contract.
- **Enhanced error handling**: The contract includes specific error types (`InvalidReportVersion`, `NotOwner`, `NothingToWithdraw`) for better debugging and user experience.
- **Cross-chain compatibility**: The automatic `FeeManager` detection makes the same contract code work on any supported network, whether fees are required or not.
