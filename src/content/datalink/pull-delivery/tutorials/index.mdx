These tutorials guide you through integrating with DataLink pull-delivery feeds, from basic data fetching to onchain verification. Choose the tutorial that matches your preferred programming language and integration method.

<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">
  These guides represent examples of using a Chainlink product or service and is provided to help you understand how to
  interact with Chainlink's systems and services so that you can integrate them into your own. This template is provided

## Getting started

Before starting any tutorial, ensure you have:

1. **API Credentials**: Access to pull-based DataLink feeds requires API credentials to connect to the Aggregation Network. If you haven't already, [contact us](https://chain.link/contact) to request access.
1. **Development Environment**: Set up your development environment for your chosen programming language (Go or Rust).
1. **Basic Understanding**: Familiarity with report schemas and the [DataLink architecture](/datalink/pull-delivery/overview) for pull-based feeds.

## Tutorials

### Fetch and decode reports (API)

Learn how to fetch and decode reports using REST API calls. This method is ideal for applications that need on-demand data retrieval.

- [Fetch and decode reports using the Go SDK (API)](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/fetch-decode/api-go)
- [Fetch and decode reports using the Rust SDK (API)](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/fetch-decode/api-rust)

### Stream and decode reports (WebSocket)

Learn how to establish real-time data streams using WebSocket connections. This method is ideal for applications that need continuous, low-latency data updates.

- [Stream and decode reports using the Go SDK (WebSocket)](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/stream-decode/ws-go)
- [Stream and decode reports using the Rust SDK (WebSocket)](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/stream-decode/ws-rust)

### Onchain verification

Learn how to verify the authenticity and integrity of report data onchain using the Verifier Proxy contracts.

- [Verify Report Data Onchain (EVM)](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/onchain-verification-evm)
