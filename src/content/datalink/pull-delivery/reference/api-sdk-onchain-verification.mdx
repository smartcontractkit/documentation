import { Aside } from "@components"

DataLink uses the same APIs, SDKs, and verification infrastructure as Chainlink Data Streams. Applications can use existing Data Streams integration patterns and tooling.

<Aside type="caution" title="Provider Responsibility & Single-Source Data">
  Some DataLink feeds rely on single-source data from individual providers. In that case, DataLink solely provides
  infrastructure for data providers to make their data available onchain. None of Chainlink Labs, the Chainlink
  Foundation, or Chainlink node operators verify, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the accuracy, reliability,
  availability, or quality of the data provided. Such responsibilities lie solely with the respective data providers.
  Protocols utilizing DataLink are strongly encouraged to independently validate that the quality and reliability of
  data received from data providers meet their use case requirements and implement comprehensive risk mitigation
  strategies, fallback mechanisms, and contingency plans to address potential inaccuracies or interruptions in data
  delivery from data providers. Any use of DataLink, whether obtained directly from Chainlink or acquired independently,
  shall remain subject to the [Terms of Service](https://chainlinklabs.com/terms).

## API Interfaces

Access DataLink feeds using the standard Data Streams Direct APIs:

- [Data Streams REST API Reference](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-interface-api): HTTP-based integrations and fetching reports on demand.
- [Data Streams WebSocket Reference](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-interface-ws): Real-time data streaming via a persistent WebSocket connection.

## SDK Integration

Integrate DataLink quickly into your applications using the existing Data Streams SDKs:

- [Data Streams Go SDK Reference](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-go-sdk): Native Go language integration.
- [Data Streams Rust SDK Reference](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-rust-sdk): Native Rust language integration.

## Report Verification

Verify the integrity of DataLink reports onchain using the same process and Verifier contracts as Data Streams:

- [Data Streams Onchain Verification Reference](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-onchain-verification): Learn how to verify report authenticity on EVM chains using the shared Verifier Proxy contracts.
