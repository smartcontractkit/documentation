DataLink pull-based feeds provide access to specialized data from Data Providers through offchain retrieval with onchain verification capabilities.

## Key Characteristics

- **Specialized market data**: Access specialized datasets directly from individual Data Providers
- **Pull-based delivery**: Fetch data on-demand via REST API or real-time via WebSocket
- **Onchain verification**: Cryptographically verify report integrity using verifier contracts
- **Proven infrastructure**: Built on the same battle-tested [Chainlink Data Streams](/data-streams) architecture

<Aside type="note" title="Infrastructure Sharing">
  Pull-based DataLink feeds use the **same underlying infrastructure** as [Chainlink Data Streams](/data-streams),
  including APIs, SDKs, and verification contracts. This ensures reliability, security, and a familiar developer
  experience.
</Aside>

## How It Works

1. **Data Providers** submit specialized data to Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs)
1. **DONs** create cryptographically signed reports and deliver them to the Chainlink Aggregation Layer
1. **Applications** fetch reports offchain via API/WebSocket and verify their integrity onchain

For detailed technical information, see the [Architecture](/datalink/pull-delivery/architecture) page.

## Getting Started

### 1. Check Network Support

Verify that your target blockchain supports onchain verification by reviewing [Supported Networks](/datalink/pull-delivery/supported-networks).

### 2. Choose Your Integration Method

- **REST API**: Fetch reports on-demand for periodic updates
- **WebSocket**: Stream real-time data for continuous applications
- **Onchain Verification**: Add cryptographic validation

### 3. Follow the Tutorials

Start with our step-by-step [Tutorials](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials) covering:

- Fetching and decoding reports via API (Go/Rust)
- Streaming and decoding reports via WebSocket (Go/Rust)
- Onchain verification for EVM chains

### 4. Reference Documentation

Consult the [Reference](/datalink/pull-delivery/reference) section for:

- Complete API and SDK documentation
- Report schema specifications
