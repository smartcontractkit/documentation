While DataLink data is accessed offchain via API or WebSocket, **onchain verification** of report integrity relies on Verifier Proxy contracts deployed to blockchain networks.

DataLink uses the **same infrastructure and Verifier Proxy contracts** as [Chainlink Data Streams](/data-streams/). Therefore, DataLink supports onchain report verification on all networks where Data Streams verifier contracts are available.

## Verifier Proxy Contract Addresses

To perform onchain verification, you need the address of the Verifier Proxy contract specific to the network you are operating on.

Find the list of supported networks and their corresponding Verifier Proxy addresses on the [Verifier Proxy Addresses](/datalink/pull-delivery/verifier-proxy-addresses) page.

## How Verification Works

The verification process involves using the Verifier Proxy contract on the relevant chain to check the signature and integrity of the report fetched via the API/WebSocket.

For a detailed explanation and code examples, see the [Onchain Verification guide](/datalink/pull-delivery/tutorials/onchain-verification-evm).
