## Contracts overview

All source code is open source and available in the [Chainlink Github repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink).

### ChainlinkClient

[`ChainlinkClient`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/ChainlinkClient.sol) is a parent contract that enables smart contracts to consume data from oracles. It's available in the Chainlink smart contract library which can be [installed using the latest package managers](/resources/create-a-chainlinked-project).

The client constructs and makes a request to a known Chainlink oracle through the `transferAndCall` function, implemented by the LINK token. This request contains encoded information that is required for the cycle to succeed. In the `ChainlinkClient` contract, this call is initiated with a call to `sendChainlinkRequestTo`.

To build your own client contract using `ChainlinkClient`, see [Introduction to Using Any API](/any-api/introduction), or view the [ChainlinkClient API Reference](/any-api/api-reference) for the `ChainlinkClient` contract.

### LINK Token

LINK is an [ERC-677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677) compliant token which implements `transferAndCall`, a function that allows tokens to be transferred whilst also triggering logic in the receiving contract within a single transaction.

Learn more about [ERC-677 and the LINK token](/resources/link-token-contracts).

### Operator Contract

[`Operator` contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol) are owned by oracle node operators, which run alongside offchain oracle nodes.

#### Request

The client contract that initiates this cycle must create a request with the following items:

- The oracle address.
- The job ID, so the oracle knows which tasks to perform.
- The callback function, which the oracle sends the response to.

To learn about how to find oracles to suit your needs, see [Find Existing Jobs](/any-api/find-oracle).

Operator contracts are responsible for handling onchain requests made through the LINK token, by implementing `onTokenTransfer` as a <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/LinkTokenReceiver.sol">`LinkTokenReceiver`</a>. Upon execution of this function, the operator contract **emits an `OracleRequest` event** containing information about the request. This event is crucial, as it is monitored by the offchain oracle node which acts upon it.

#### Fulfillment

For fulfillment, the operator contract has a `fulfillOracleRequest` function which is used by the node to fulfill a request once it has the result of the job. This function returns the result to the `ChainlinkClient` using the callback function defined in the original request.

### Offchain oracle node

The offchain oracle node is responsible for listening for events emitted by its corresponding onchain smart contract. Once it detects an `OracleRequest` event, it uses the data emitted to perform a job.

The most common job type for a Node is to make a GET request to an API, retrieve some data from it, parse the response, convert the result into blockchain compatible data, then submit it in a transaction back to the operator contract, using the `fulfillOracleRequest` function.

For more information on how to become a node operator, learn how to [run a Chainlink node](/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node).

## Consumer UML
