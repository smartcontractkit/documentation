## Basic request model

Chainlink connects smart contracts with external data using its decentralized oracle network. Chainlink API requests are handled 1:1 by an oracle.

The [Basic Request Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model) describes the onchain architecture of requesting data from a single oracle source. This request model still describes how Data Feeds works.

Historically, [Any API](/any-api/get-request/introduction) was used to make GET requests using a single oracle. Currently, we recommend using Chainlink Functions to send a request to the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). Learn about the [Request and Receive Data model](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) used in Chainlink Functions.

## Decentralized data model

For a more robust and trustworthy answer, you can aggregate data from many oracles. With onchain aggregation, data is aggregated from a decentralized network of independent oracle nodes. This architecture is applied to Chainlink Data Feeds, which can aggregate data such as asset price data.

The [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model) describes how data is aggregated, and how consumer contracts can retrieve this data.

## Offchain reporting

Offchain Reporting (OCR) is an improvement on the decentralization and scalability of Chainlink networks. With our Offchain Reporting aggregators, all nodes communicate using a peer to peer network. During the communication process, a lightweight consensus algorithm runs where each node reports its price observation and signs it. A single aggregate transaction is then transmitted, which saves a significant amount of gas.

To learn more about OCR and how it works, see the [Offchain Reporting](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) page.
