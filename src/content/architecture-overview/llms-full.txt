## [What is a smart contract? What is a hybrid smart contract?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#what-is-a-smart-contract-what-is-a-hybrid-smart-contract)

When deployed to a blockchain, a _smart contract_ is a set of instructions that can be executed without intervention from third parties. The smart contract code defines how it responds to input, just like the code of any other computer program.

A valuable feature of smart contracts is that they can store and manage onchain assets (like [ETH or ERC20 tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)), just like you can with an Ethereum wallet. Because they have an onchain address like a wallet, they can do everything any other address can. This enables you to program automated actions when receiving and transferring assets.

Smart contracts can connect to real-world market prices of assets to produce powerful applications. Securely connecting smart contracts with offchain data and services is what makes them _hybrid_ smart contracts. This is done using oracles.

## [What language is a smart contract written in?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#what-language-is-a-smart-contract-written-in)

The most popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM Chains is [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/). It was created by the Ethereum Foundation specifically for smart contract development and is constantly being updated. Other languages exist for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM Chains, but Solidity is the language used for Chainlink smart contracts.

If you've ever written Javascript, Java, or other object-oriented scripting languages, Solidity should be easy to understand. Similar to object-oriented languages, Solidity is considered to be a _contract_-oriented language.

Some networks are not EVM-compatible and use languages other than Solidity for smart contracts, such as [Solana in Rust](https://solana.com/docs/programs/rust) or Starknet in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/).

## [What does a smart contract look like?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#what-does-a-smart-contract-look-like)

The structure of a smart contract is similar to that of a class in Javascript, with a few differences. For example, the following `HelloWorld` contract is a simple smart contract that stores a single variable and includes a function to update the value of that variable.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.7;

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */

contract HelloWorld {
    string public message;

    constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
        message = initialMessage;
    }

    function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
        message = newMessage;
    }
}

```

[Open in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/Tutorials/HelloWorld.sol&autoCompile=true) [What is Remix?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview#what-is-remix)

### [Solidity versions](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#solidity-versions)

The first thing that every Solidity file must have is the Solidity version definition. The `HelloWorld.sol` contract uses version `0.8.7`, which is defined in the contract as `pragma solidity 0.8.7;`

You can see the latest versions of the Solidity compiler [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt/?target=_blank). You might also notice smart contracts that are compatible with a range of versions.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

```

This means that the code is written for Solidity version 0.7.0, or a newer version of the language up to, but not including version 0.9.0. The `pragma` selects the compiler, which defines how the code is treated.

### [Naming a Contract](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#naming-a-contract)

The `contract` keyword defines the name of the contract, which in this example is `HelloWorld`. This is similar to declaring a `class` in Javascript. The implementation of `HelloWorld` is inside this definition and denoted with curly braces.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {

}

```

### [Variables](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#variables)

Like Javascript, contracts can have state variables and local variables. **State variables** are variables with values that are permanently stored in contract storage. The values of **local variables**, however, are present only until the function is executing. There are also different types of variables you can use within Solidity, such as `string`, `uint256`, etc. Check out the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/) to learn more about the different kinds of variables and types.

_Visibility modifiers_ are used to define the level of access to these variables. Here are some examples of state variables with different visibility modifiers:

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
string public message;
uint256 internal internalVar;
uint8 private privateVar;

```

Learn more about state variables visibility [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#state-variable-visibility).

### [Constructors](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#constructors)

Another familiar concept to programmers is the **constructor**. When you deploy a contract, the constructor sets the state of the contract when it is first created.

In `HelloWorld`, the constructor takes in a `string` as a parameter and sets the `message` state variable to that string.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
  message = initialMessage;
}

```

### [Functions](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#functions)

**Functions** can access and modify the state of the contract or call other functions on external contracts. `HelloWorld` has a function named `updateMessage`, which updates the current message stored in the state.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
  message = initialMessage;
}

function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
  message = newMessage;
}

```

Functions use visibility modifiers to define the access level. Learn more about functions visibility [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-visibility).

### [Interfaces](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#interfaces)

An **interface** is another concept that is familiar to programmers of other languages. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves. This makes it easier to know what functions to call in a contract. Here's an example of an interface:

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.7;

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */

interface numberComparison {
    function isSameNum(uint a, uint b) external view returns (bool);
}

contract Test is numberComparison {
    constructor() {}

    function isSameNum(uint a, uint b) external pure override returns (bool) {
        if (a == b) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}

```

[Open in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/Tutorials/Test.sol&autoCompile=true) [What is Remix?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview#what-is-remix)

For this example, `override` is necessary in the `Test` contract function because it overrides the base function contained in the `numberComparison` interface. The contract uses `pure` instead of `view` because the `isSameNum` function in the `Test` contract does not return a storage variable.

## [What does "deploying" mean?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#what-does-deploying-mean)

**Deploying** a smart contract is the process of pushing the code to the blockchain, at which point it resides with an onchain address. Once it's deployed, the code cannot be changed and is said to be _immutable_.

As long as the address is known, its functions can be called through an interface, on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), or through a library like [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), [web3py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/), [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/), and more. Contracts can also be written to interact with other contracts on the blockchain.

## [What is a LINK token?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#what-is-a-link-token)

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the [ERC20 token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. It is used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators.

Any wallet that handles ERC20 tokens can store LINK tokens. The ERC677 token standard that the LINK token implements still retains all functionality of ERC20 tokens.

## [What are oracles?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#what-are-oracles)

**Oracles** provide a bridge between the real-world and onchain smart contracts by being a source of data that smart contracts can rely on, and act upon.

Oracles play a critical role in facilitating the full potential of smart contract utility. Without a reliable connection to real-world conditions, smart contracts cannot effectively serve the real-world.

## [How do smart contracts use oracles?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#how-do-smart-contracts-use-oracles)

Oracles are most popularly used with [_Data Feeds_](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds). DeFi platforms like [AAVE](https://aave.com/) and [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) use Chainlink data feed oracles to obtain accurate real-time asset prices in their smart contracts.

Chainlink data feeds are sources of data [aggregated from many independent Chainlink node operators](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model). Each data feed has an onchain address and functions that enable contracts to read from that address. For example, the [ETH / USD feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd).

![Chainlink Feeds List](https://docs.chain.link/images/contract-devs/price-aggr.png)

Smart contracts also use oracles to get other capabilities onchain:

- [Generate Verifiable Random Numbers (VRF)](https://docs.chain.link/vrf): Use Chainlink VRF to consume randomness in your smart contracts.
- [Call External APIs (Any API)](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/introduction): Request & Receive data from any API using the Chainlink contract library.
- [Automate Smart Contracts using Chainlink Automation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation): Automating smart contract functions and regular contract maintenance.

## [What is Remix?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#what-is-remix)

Play

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a web IDE (integrated development environment) for creating, running, and debugging smart contracts in the browser. It is developed and maintained by the Ethereum foundation. Remix allows Solidity developers to write smart contracts without a development machine since everything required is included in the web interface. It allows for a simplified method of interacting with deployed contracts, without the need for a command line interface. Remix also has support for samples. This means that Remix can load code from Github.

To learn how to use Remix, see the [Deploying Your First Smart Contract](https://docs.chain.link/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract) guide.

[Deploy Your First Smart Contract](https://docs.chain.link/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract/)

## [What is MetaMask?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview\#what-is-metamask)

Contracts are deployed by other addresses on the network. To deploy a smart contract, you need an address. Not only that, but you need an address which you can easily use with Remix. Fortunately, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is just what is needed. **MetaMask** allows anyone to create an address, store funds, and interact with Ethereum compatible blockchains from a browser extension.

## [What is a smart contract? What is a hybrid smart contract?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#what-is-a-smart-contract-what-is-a-hybrid-smart-contract)

The structure of a smart contract is similar to that of a class in Javascript, with a few differences. For example, the following `HelloWorld` contract is a simple smart contract that stores a single variable and includes a function to update the value of that variable.

 */

contract HelloWorld {
    string public message;

    constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
        message = initialMessage;
    }

    function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
        message = newMessage;
    }
}

```

[Open in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/Tutorials/HelloWorld.sol&autoCompile=true) [What is Remix?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview#what-is-remix)

### [Solidity versions](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#solidity-versions)

The first thing that every Solidity file must have is the Solidity version definition. The `HelloWorld.sol` contract uses version `0.8.7`, which is defined in the contract as `pragma solidity 0.8.7;`

You can see the latest versions of the Solidity compiler [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt/?target=_blank). You might also notice smart contracts that are compatible with a range of versions.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

```

This means that the code is written for Solidity version 0.7.0, or a newer version of the language up to, but not including version 0.9.0. The `pragma` selects the compiler, which defines how the code is treated.

### [Naming a Contract](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#naming-a-contract)

The `contract` keyword defines the name of the contract, which in this example is `HelloWorld`. This is similar to declaring a `class` in Javascript. The implementation of `HelloWorld` is inside this definition and denoted with curly braces.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {

}

```

### [Variables](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#variables)

Like Javascript, contracts can have state variables and local variables. **State variables** are variables with values that are permanently stored in contract storage. The values of **local variables**, however, are present only until the function is executing. There are also different types of variables you can use within Solidity, such as `string`, `uint256`, etc. Check out the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/) to learn more about the different kinds of variables and types.

_Visibility modifiers_ are used to define the level of access to these variables. Here are some examples of state variables with different visibility modifiers:

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
string public message;
uint256 internal internalVar;
uint8 private privateVar;

```

Learn more about state variables visibility [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#state-variable-visibility).

### [Constructors](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#constructors)

Another familiar concept to programmers is the **constructor**. When you deploy a contract, the constructor sets the state of the contract when it is first created.

In `HelloWorld`, the constructor takes in a `string` as a parameter and sets the `message` state variable to that string.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
  message = initialMessage;
}

```

### [Functions](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#functions)

**Functions** can access and modify the state of the contract or call other functions on external contracts. `HelloWorld` has a function named `updateMessage`, which updates the current message stored in the state.

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
  message = initialMessage;
}

function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
  message = newMessage;
}

```

Functions use visibility modifiers to define the access level. Learn more about functions visibility [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-visibility).

### [Interfaces](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#interfaces)

An **interface** is another concept that is familiar to programmers of other languages. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves. This makes it easier to know what functions to call in a contract. Here's an example of an interface:

![copy to clipboard](https://docs.chain.link/assets/icons/copyIcon.svg)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.7;

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */

interface numberComparison {
    function isSameNum(uint a, uint b) external view returns (bool);
}

contract Test is numberComparison {
    constructor() {}

    function isSameNum(uint a, uint b) external pure override returns (bool) {
        if (a == b) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}

```

[Open in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/Tutorials/Test.sol&autoCompile=true) [What is Remix?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview#what-is-remix)

For this example, `override` is necessary in the `Test` contract function because it overrides the base function contained in the `numberComparison` interface. The contract uses `pure` instead of `view` because the `isSameNum` function in the `Test` contract does not return a storage variable.

## [What does "deploying" mean?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#what-does-deploying-mean)

**Deploying** a smart contract is the process of pushing the code to the blockchain, at which point it resides with an onchain address. Once it's deployed, the code cannot be changed and is said to be _immutable_.

Contracts can also be written to interact with other contracts on the blockchain.

## [What is a LINK token?](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview?parent=dataStreams\#what-is-a-link-token)

Contracts are deployed by other addresses on the network. To deploy a smart contract, you need an address. Not only that, but you need an address which you can easily use with Remix. Fortunately, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is just what is needed. **MetaMask** allows anyone to create an address, store funds, and interact with Ethereum compatible blockchains from a browser extension.

Chainlink CCIP is now officially live on Solana. [View lanes and tokens.](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/solana-mainnet?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=chainlink-docs&utm_campaign=solana-ccip)

# [LINK Token Contracts](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts\#overview)

* * *

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

Chainlink CCIP is now officially live on Solana. [View lanes and tokens.](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/solana-mainnet?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=chainlink-docs&utm_campaign=solana-ccip)

# [LINK Token Contracts](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=chainlinkFunctions\#overview)

* * *

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

## LINK Token Contracts
[iframe](https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-N6DQ47T)

Chainlink CCIP is now officially live on Solana. [View lanes and tokens.](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/solana-mainnet?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=chainlink-docs&utm_campaign=solana-ccip)

# [LINK Token Contracts](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=dataStreams\#overview)

* * *

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

## LINK Token Contracts
[iframe](https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-N6DQ47T)

Chainlink CCIP is now officially live on Solana. [View lanes and tokens.](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/solana-mainnet?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=chainlink-docs&utm_campaign=solana-ccip)

# [LINK Token Contracts](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=dataFeeds\#overview)

* * *

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

## LINK Token Contracts
[iframe](https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-N6DQ47T)

Chainlink CCIP is now officially live on Solana. [View lanes and tokens.](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/solana-mainnet?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=chainlink-docs&utm_campaign=solana-ccip)

# [LINK Token Contracts](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=vrf\#overview)

* * *

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

## LINK Token Contracts
[iframe](https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-N6DQ47T)

Chainlink CCIP is now officially live on Solana. [View lanes and tokens.](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/solana-mainnet?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=chainlink-docs&utm_campaign=solana-ccip)

# [LINK Token Contracts](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=automation\#overview)

* * *

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

## Chainlink Data Architecture

Chainlink CCIP is now officially live on Solana. [View lanes and tokens.](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/solana-mainnet?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=chainlink-docs&utm_campaign=solana-ccip)

# [Data Feeds Architecture](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-overview\#overview)

## [Basic request model](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-overview\#basic-request-model)

Chainlink connects smart contracts with external data using its decentralized oracle network. Chainlink API requests are handled 1:1 by an oracle.

The [Basic Request Model](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model) describes the onchain architecture of requesting data from a single oracle source.

To learn how to make a GET request using a single oracle, see [Make a GET Request](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/get-request/introduction).

## [Decentralized data model](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-overview\#decentralized-data-model)

For a more robust and trustworthy answer, you can aggregate data from many oracles. With onchain aggregation, data is aggregated from a decentralized network of independent oracle nodes. This architecture is applied to Chainlink Data Feeds, which can aggregate data such as asset price data.

The [Decentralized Data Model](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model) describes how data is aggregated, and how consumer contracts can retrieve this data.

## [Offchain reporting](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-overview\#offchain-reporting)

Offchain Reporting (OCR) is an improvement on the decentralization and scalability of Chainlink networks. With our Offchain Reporting aggregators, all nodes communicate using a peer to peer network. During the communication process, a lightweight consensus algorithm runs where each node reports its price observation and signs it. A single aggregate transaction is then transmitted, which saves a significant amount of gas.

To learn more about OCR and how it works, see the [Offchain Reporting](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) page.

# Contracts Overview

All source code is open source and available in the [Chainlink GitHub repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink).

## ChainlinkClient

`ChainlinkClient` is a parent contract that enables smart contracts to consume data from oracles. It's available in the Chainlink smart contract library, which can be installed using the latest package managers.

The client constructs and makes a request to a known Chainlink oracle through the `transferAndCall` function, implemented by the LINK token. This request contains encoded information required for the cycle to succeed.

In the `ChainlinkClient` contract, this call is initiated with a call to `sendChainlinkRequestTo`.

To build your own client contract using `ChainlinkClient`, see [Introduction to Using Any API](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model), or view the [ChainlinkClient API Reference](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model) for the `ChainlinkClient` contract.

## LINK Token

LINK is an ERC-677 compliant token which implements `transferAndCall`, a function that allows tokens to be transferred whilst also triggering logic in the receiving contract within a single transaction.

Learn more about [ERC-677 and the LINK token](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model).

## Operator Contract

Operator contracts are owned by oracle node operators, which run alongside offchain oracle nodes.

## Request

The client contract that initiates this cycle must create a request with the following items:

- The oracle address.
- The job ID, so the oracle knows which tasks to perform.
- The callback function, which the oracle sends the response to.

To learn about how to find oracles to suit your needs, see [Find Existing Jobs](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model).

Operator contracts are responsible for handling onchain requests made through the LINK token, by implementing `onTokenTransfer` as a `LinkTokenReceiver`. Upon execution of this function, the operator contract emits an `OracleRequest` event containing information about the request.

This event is crucial, as it is monitored by the offchain oracle node which acts upon it.

## Fulfillment

For fulfillment, the operator contract has a `fulfillOracleRequest` function which is used by the node to fulfill a request once it has the result of the job. This function returns the result to the `ChainlinkClient` using the callback function defined in the original request.

## Offchain Oracle Node

The offchain oracle node is responsible for listening for events emitted by its corresponding onchain smart contract. Once it detects an `OracleRequest` event, it uses the data emitted to perform a job.

The most common job type for a Node is to make a GET request to an API, retrieve some data from it, parse the response, convert the result into blockchain-compatible data, then submit it in a transaction back to the operator contract, using the `fulfillOracleRequest` function.

For more information on how to become a node operator, learn how to [run a Chainlink node](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model).

This page describes how data aggregation is applied to produce Chainlink Data Feeds and provides more insight as to how Data Feeds are updated.

## Data aggregation

Each data feed is updated by multiple, independent Chainlink oracle operators. The [AccessControlledOffchainAggregator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/master/contract/AccessControlledOffchainAggregator.sol) aggregates the data onchain.

Offchain Reporting (OCR) further enhances the aggregation process. To learn more about OCR and how it works, see the [Offchain Reporting](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) page.

<ClickToZoom src="/images/contract-devs/price-aggr.png" />

## Shared data resource

Each data feed is built and funded by the community of users who rely on accurate, up-to-date data in their smart contracts. As more users rely on and contribute to a data feed, the quality of the data feed improves. For this reason, each data feed has its own properties depending on the needs of its community of users.

## Decentralized Oracle Network

Each data feed is updated by a decentralized oracle network. Each oracle operator is rewarded for publishing data. The number of oracles contributing to each feed varies. In order for an update to take place, the data feed aggregator contract must receive responses from a minimum number of oracles or the latest answer will not be updated. You can see the minimum number of oracles for the corresponding feed at [data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link).

Each oracle in the set publishes data during an aggregation round. That data is validated and aggregated by a smart contract, which forms the feed's latest and trusted answer.

## Components of a Decentralized Oracle Network

Data Feeds are an example of a decentralized oracle network, and include the following components:

- [A consumer contract](#consumer)
- [A proxy contract](#proxy)
- [An aggregator contract](#aggregator)

To learn how to create a consumer contract that uses an existing data feed, read the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) documentation.

### Consumer

A Consumer contract is any contract that uses Chainlink Data Feeds to consume aggregated data. Consumer contracts must reference the correct [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) contract and call one of the exposed functions.

```solidity
...
AggregatorV3Interface feed = AggregatorV3Interface(address);
return feed.latestRoundData();
```

Offchain applications can also consume data feeds. See the Javascript and Python example code on the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) page to learn more.

### Proxy

Proxy contracts are onchain proxies that point to the aggregator for a particular data feed. Using proxies enables the underlying aggregator to be upgraded without any service interruption to consuming contracts.

Proxy contracts can vary from one data feed to another, but the [`EACAggregatorProxy.sol` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.6/EACAggregatorProxy.sol) on Github is a common example.

### Aggregator

An aggregator is the contract that receives periodic data updates from the oracle network. Aggregators store aggregated data onchain so that consumers can retrieve it and act upon it within the same transaction.

You can access this data using the Data Feed address and the [`AggregatorV3Interface` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol).

Aggregators receive updates from the oracle network only when the **Deviation Threshold** or **Heartbeat Threshold** triggers an update during an aggregation round. The first condition that is met triggers an update to the data.

- Deviation Threshold: A new aggregation round starts when a node identifies that the off-chain values deviate by more than the defined deviation threshold from the onchain value. Individual nodes monitor one or more data providers for each feed.
- Heartbeat Threshold: A new aggregation round starts after a specified amount of time from the last update.

# https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting llms-full.txt

Offchain Reporting (OCR) is a significant step towards increasing the decentralization and scalability of Chainlink networks. See the [OCR Protocol Paper](https://research.chain.link/ocr.pdf) for a technical deep dive.

For Offchain Reporting aggregators, all nodes communicate using a peer to peer network. During the communication process, a lightweight consensus algorithm runs where each node reports its data observation and signs it. A single aggregate transaction is then transmitted, which saves a significant amount of gas.

The report contained in the aggregate transaction is signed by a quorum of oracles and contains all oracles' observations. By validating the report onchain and checking the quorum's signatures onchain, we preserve the trustlessness properties of Chainlink oracle networks.

## What is OCR?

Imagine ordering 10 items from an online store. Each item is packaged separately and posted separately, meaning postage and packaging costs must be applied to each one, and the carrier has to transport 10 different boxes.

OCR, on the other hand, packages all of these items into a single box and posts that. This saves postage and packaging fees and all effort the carrier associates with transporting 9 fewer boxes.

The OCR protocol allows nodes to aggregate their observations into a single report offchain using a secure P2P network. A single node then submits a transaction with the aggregated report to the chain. Each report consists of many nodes' observations and has to be signed by a quorum of nodes. These signatures are verified onchain.

Submitting only one transaction per round achieves the following benefits:

- Overall network congestion from Chainlink oracle networks is reduced dramatically
- Individual node operators spend far less on gas costs
- Node networks are more scalable because data feeds can accommodate more nodes
- Data feeds can be updated in a more timely manner since each round needn't wait for multiple transactions to be confirmed before a price is confirmed onchain.

## How does OCR work?

Protocol execution happens mostly offchain over a peer to peer network between Chainlink nodes. The nodes regularly elect a new leader node that drives the rest of the protocol.

The leader regularly requests followers to provide freshly signed observations and aggregates them into a report. It then sends this report back to the followers and asks them to verify the report's validity. If a quorum of followers approves the report by sending a signed copy back to the leader, the leader assembles a final report with the quorum's signatures and broadcasts it to all followers.

The nodes attempt to transmit the final report to the aggregator contract according to a randomized schedule. The aggregator verifies that a quorum of nodes signed the report and exposes the median value to consumers as an answer with a block timestamp and a round ID.

All nodes watch the blockchain for the final report to remove any single point of failure during transmission. If the designated node fails to get their transmission confirmed within a determined period, a round-robin protocol kicks in so other nodes can also transmit the final report until one of them is confirmed.

# https://docs.chain.link/resources/network-integration llms-full.txt

Before an EVM blockchain network can integrate with Chainlink, it must meet certain technical requirements. These requirements are critical for Chainlink nodes and Chainlink services to function correctly on a given network.

The standard EVM requirements required to integrate EVM blockchain networks with Chainlink services can vary, are subject to change, and are provided here for reference purposes only. Chainlink services may have unique requirements that are in addition to the requirements discussed herein.

## Standard EVM requirements

### Solidity global variables and opcode implementation

Solidity global variables and opcode implementation constructs must meet the following requirements in order for Chainlink services to operate correctly and as expected:

- **Global variables:** Support all global variables as specified in the Solidity [Block and Transaction Properties](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties) documentation. For example, the following variables must be supported:
  - `block.blockhash` must return the hash of the requested block for the last 256 blocks
  - `block.number` must return the respective chain's block number
  - `block.chainID` must return the current chain ID
  - `block.timestamp` must return the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch
- **Opcodes:** Support all opcodes and expected behaviors from the [OpCodes.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/tests/solidity/contracts/OpCodes.sol) contract
- **Precompiles:** Must support all precompile contracts and expected behaviors listed in the Solidity [Mathematical and Cryptographic Functions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions) documentation
- **Contract size:** Must support the maximum contract size defined in [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170)
- **Nonce:** The transaction nonce must increase as transactions are confirmed and propagated to all nodes in the network.

### Finality

Blockchain development teams must ensure that blocks with a commitment level of _finalized_ are actually final. The properties of the finality mechanism, including underlying assumptions and conditions under which finality violations could occur, must be clearly documented and communicated to application developers in the blockchain ecosystem.

Furthermore, this information should be accessible through RPC API tags _finalized_ from the [JSON-RPC specification tags](#support-the-ethereum-json-rpc-specification) described later in this document.

### Standardized RPCs with SLAs

Chainlink nodes use RPCs to communicate with the chain and perform soak testing. It is not possible to ensure the functionality of Chainlink services if RPCs are unstable, underperforming, or nonexistent. RPCs must meet the following requirements:

**Dedicated RPC node:**

- The chain must provide instructions and hardware requirements to set up and run a full node.
- The archive node setup must also be provided and allow queries of blocks from genesis with transaction history and logs.
- The RPC node must enable and allow configurable settings for the following items:
  - Batch calls
  - Log lookbacks
  - HTTPS and WSS connections

**RPC providers:**

- Three separate independent RPC providers must be available.
- RPC providers must ensure there is no rate limit.
- RPC providers must have a valid SSL certificate.
- During the trailing 30 days, the RPC providers must meet the following RPC performance requirements:
  - Uptime: At least 99.9%
  - Throughput: Support at least 300 calls per second
  - Latency: Less than 250ms
  - Support SLA: For SEV1 issues, provide a Time to Answer (TTA) of at most 1 hour

### Support the Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification

The chain must support the [Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc). Chainlink services use several methods to operate on the chain and require a specific response format to those calls in line with the JSON RPC standard of Ethereum. If a response does not match this required format, the call fails and the Chainlink node will stop functioning properly.

The following methods are specifically required and must follow the [Ethereum RPC API specification](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/):

- [GetCode](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getcode)
- [Call](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_call)
- [ChainID](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_chainid)
- [SendTransaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_sendtransaction)
- [SendRawTransaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_sendrawtransaction)
- [GetTransactionReceipt](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactionreceipt)
- [GetTransactionByHash](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactionbyhash)
- [EstimateGas](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_estimategas)
- [GasPrice](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gasprice)
- [GetTransactionCount](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactioncount)
- [GetLogs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getlogs)
  - Must follow the spec as defined in [EIP-1474](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1474.md?plain=1#L856). The "latest" block number returned by `GetBlockByNumber` must also be served by `GetLogs` with logs.
  - Must accept the `blockhash` param as defined in [EIP-234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-234.md)
- [GetBalance](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getbalance)
- [GetBlockByNumber](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getblockbynumber)
- [GetBlockByHash](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getblockbyhash)

The above RPC methods must have the expected request and response params with expected data types and values as described in the [Execution-api spec](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/tests) and [Ethereum RPC API Spec](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/).

The network must also support the following items:

- **Subscription Methods:** [Websocket JSON-RPC subscription methods](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/pubsub)
  - `eth_subscribe` with support for subscription to `newHeads` and `logs`
- **Tags:** The RPC methods must support the `finalized`, `latest`, and `pending` tags where applicable. They must also support natural numbers for blocks.
- **Batch Requests:** Must support batching of requests for the `GetLogs` and `GetBlockByNumber` methods.
- **Response size:** Any RPC request including the batch requests must be within the allowed size limit of around 173MB.

### `eth_sendRawTransaction` error message mapping to Geth client error messages

Chains must provide an error message mapping between their specific implementation to the error messages detailed below.

When the `eth_sendRawTransaction` call fails, Chainlink nodes must be able to recognize these error categories and determine the next appropriate action. If the error categories are different or cannot be mapped correctly, the Chainlink node will stop functioning properly and stop sending transactions to the chain. The following error messages are specifically critical:

| Error                               | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NonceTooLow`                       | Returned when the nonce used for the transaction is too low to use. This nonce likely has been already used on the chain previously.                             |
| `NonceTooHigh`                      | Returned when the nonce used for the transaction is higher than what the chain can use right now.                                                                |
| `ReplacementTransactionUnderpriced` | Returned when the transaction gas price used is too low. There is another transaction with the same nonce in the queue, with a higher price.                     |
| `LimitReached`                      | Returned when there are too many outstanding transactions on the node.                                                                                           |
| `TransactionAlreadyInMempool`       | Returned when this current transaction was already received and stored.                                                                                          |
| `TerminallyUnderpriced`             | Returned when the transaction's gas price is too low and won't be accepted by the node.                                                                          |
| `InsufficientEth`                   | Returned when the account doesn't have enough funds to send this transaction.                                                                                    |
| `TxFeeExceedsCap`                   | Returned when the transaction gas fees exceed the configured cap by this node, and won't be accepted.                                                            |
| `L2FeeTooLow`                       | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. Returned when the gas fees are too low, When this error occurs the Suggested Gas Price is fetched again transaction is retried.  |
| `L2FeeTooHigh`                      | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. Returned when the total fee is too high. When this error occurs the Suggested Gas Price is fetched again transaction is retried. |
| `L2Full`                            | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. The node is too full, and cannot handle more transactions.                                                                       |
| `TransactionAlreadyMined`           | Returned when the current transaction was already accepted and mined into a block.                                                                               |
| `Fatal`                             | Return when something is seriously wrong with the transaction, and the transaction will never be accepted in the current format.                                 |

For examples of how other chains or clients are using these categories, see the [error.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/error.go) file in the [go-ethereum repo](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) on GitHub.

For chains with zk-proofs, chains must reject transactions that cause zk-proof overflow with a uniquely identifiable error message.

Any other reasons why transactions might be rejected by a node or sequencer other than malformed input/gasLimits must be detailed.

### Clarify use of transaction types

For [transaction types](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/types/transaction.go#L48-51) other than `0x0 - Legacy`, `0x1 - Access List`, `0x2 - Dynamic`, and `0x3 - Blob`, networks must clarify how each transaction type is used. Chainlink nodes must know if the chain uses other types for regular transactions with regular gas so it can correctly estimate gas costs.

### Multi-signature wallet support

The chain must provide a supported and audited multi-signature wallet implementation with a UI.

### Block explorer support

The chain must provide a block explorer and support for contract and verification APIs.

## Why should you contribute?

[Open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) is a model that brings multiple benefits for both the project and the contributors. As a developer or community member, contributing to Chainlink helps you to gain valuable skills and experience, improve the software that you use, and grow your personal brand in the community which can lead to future employment opportunities. On top of these awesome things, contributing to open source is fun. It can give you a sense of community involvement, and gives you a personal sense of satisfaction knowing that you're part of an effort to build something that will enable a fairer, more transparent, and efficient new world.

## Contributing to software and tooling

The most direct way you can contribute to Chainlink is to contribute to the core code or the various tooling found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/). Contributing to code or code-based tools can generally be split into a few different categories:

- Raising an issue
- Requesting a new feature
- Submitting a Pull Request (PR) for a fix, improvement, or new tool

### Raising an issue

During the course of using Chainlink software or tools, you might encounter errors or unexpected behavior that leads you to believe the software isn't behaving correctly. You can bring this to the attention of the Chainlink Labs team as well as the wider developer community by raising an issue in the project’s GitHub repository. The 'Issues' tab lists all of the open issues for the repository.

After an issue is raised and tagged, the Chainlink Labs team and the wider community can address it. This gives the issue the visibility required for someone to investigate it and resolve the issue.

When you first create an issue, you must also categorize it. This prefixes the issue name to give viewers an indication of what category the issue relates to:

- [NODE]: The issue relates to the core node software
- [DEVEL]: The issue is a result of working on code found in the current repository
- [FEAT]: The issue relates to a new feature request
- [SMRT]: The issue related to using Chainlink smart contracts
- [EXPL]: The issue related to using the Chainlink Explorer
- [FAUC]: The issue related to using the Chainlink Faucet

![Selecting the new issue category](/files/new-issue-category.png)

After you select a category, enter the details for the issue. Include as much detail about the issue as possible. Provide a thorough description, environment, and software version details. Also provide detailed steps that describe how to reproduce the issue. The more thorough you make your description, the better the chances are that someone will be able to pick up the issue and resolve it.

Once a team member acknowledges that the issue has been received, they will tag it with an appropriate label. You should then monitor the state of the open issue for any questions or updates.

### Requesting a new feature

Have you thought of an improvement or an awesome new feature that you think should be implemented into Chainlink? Request a new feature to bring it to the attention of the team and the wider community. You can request new features by creating a new GitHub issue in the correct repository and tagging that issue with the [FEAT] prefix (Feature request). The process for doing this is covered in the [Raising an Issue](#raising-an-issue) section. Provide as much detail as possible in your feature request, including any benefits, risks, or considerations that you can think of.

#### Voting on new features

Sometimes a new feature is put to a vote to decide if it's something that the team and wider community should implement. When a feature is put to a vote, the issue is tagged with the 'needs votes' label. You can contribute to the voting process by reacting to the first post in the feature request with a thumbs up or thumbs down emoji. This will help drive the decision. You can also contribute your thoughts by replying directly to the feature request with a new post in the thread.

![Voting on a new feature request](/files/voting-issue.png)

### Submitting a pull request

The best way to contribute to Chainlink is to submit a [pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). PRs can be submitted for various reasons, such as fixing an identified issue, adding a feature or improvement to the project, or even adding an entirely new repository to the Chainlink source code for a new tool or feature. If you're looking for something to pick up and create a PR for, you can search through the Chainlink repositories to find open issues, and approved feature requests.

If you're new to contributing to open-source software or Chainlink, we've tagged some [good first issues](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) against the main node software and smart contracts that you can tackle. Each major repository in the Chainlink GitHub should also have some good first issues tagged for developers to be able to take on.

All code changes must follow the [style guide] (https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/wiki/Code-Style-Guide), All PRs must be in an appropriately named branch with a format like 'feat/feature-description' or 'devel/issue-description'. After you submit a PR, you should get a response by a team member within a day or two acknowledging that the PR has been received. After that, monitor the PR for any additional questions or updates that come up while the team and the community review the changes.

## Contributing to the documentation

The [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/) is the go-to place for developers who want to learn how to build applications using Chainlink, and node operators wanting useful information on running a Chainlink node. The documentation is [open source](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation), allowing for other developers and community members to contribute to adding or improving it. You can contribute to the Chainlink documentation in various ways:

- Improving the readability of pages
- Fixing typos or grammar errors
- Adding new guides or tutorials that you would find useful
- Translating the documentation into other languages

The process for contributing to the documentation follows the process defined earlier in the [Submitting a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request) section. Each page also has a 'Suggest Edits' link on the top right, and will directly take you to the page in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation), where you can create a new PR with the suggested changes. Before you create a PR for the documentation, read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you want to translate the documentation into a new language that is not yet supported, feel free to [reach out to the team](mailto:devrel@smartcontract.com) beforehand, so we can make sure you get the support you need.
