This guide explains how to use Chainlink Local to run CCIP in a localhost environment in any smart contract development framework.

To set up local simulator mode:

1. Import the `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol` singleton contract from the `@chainlink/local` package.
1. Deploy it on your local development network.

After deployment, the simulator is ready to use.

## Using Foundry or Hardhat

import { CCIPLocalSimulator } from "@chainlink/local/src/ccip/CCIPLocalSimulator.sol"

contract Demo is Test {
CCIPLocalSimulator public ccipLocalSimulator;

    function setUp() public {
        ccipLocalSimulator = new CCIPLocalSimulator();

        (
            uint64 chainSelector,
            IRouterClient sourceRouter,
            IRouterClient destinationRouter,
            WETH9 wrappedNative,
            LinkToken linkToken,
            BurnMintERC677Helper ccipBnM,
            BurnMintERC677Helper ccipLnM
        ) = ccipLocalSimulator.configuration();

    }

}

Create CCIPLocalSimulator.sol file inside the contracts folder and paste the following code:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import {CCIPLocalSimulator} from "@chainlink/local/src/ccip/CCIPLocalSimulator.sol";
And then use it inside your JavaScript/TypeScript tests and scripts:

Copy
async function deploy() {
const localSimulatorFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("CCIPLocalSimulator");
const localSimulator = await localSimulatorFactory.deploy();

const config: {
chainSelector*: bigint;
sourceRouter*: string;
destinationRouter*: string;
wrappedNative*: string;
linkToken*: string;
ccipBnM*: string;
ccipLnM\_: string;
} = await localSimulator.configuration();

return { localSimulator };
}

</Fragment>
</TabsContent>

## Using Remix IDE

1. Create a file named `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol` and paste the following code:

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

   import { CCIPLocalSimulator } from "https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local/blob/main/src/ccip/CCIPLocalSimulator.sol";
   ```

1. Compile it and deploy it to Remix VM.

   If deployment fails, go back to the **Solidity Compile** tab, expand the **Advanced Configuration** menu, and under
   _Compiler configuration_, check the _Enable optimization_ check box. Compile it and try deploying it again.

1. Deploy your smart contracts using addresses provided by the `configuration()` function (Router, LinkToken, etc.). After you deploy your smart contracts, thesimulator is set up and ready for you to start testing your smart contracts.

   If you encounter the `NotEnoughGasForCall` custom error provided by the Router smart contract, scroll up to the **Gas Limit** section,
   select the **Custom** radio button and try again.
