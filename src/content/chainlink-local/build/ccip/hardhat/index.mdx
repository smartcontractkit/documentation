This documentation provides two comprehensive guides to help you test Chainlink CCIP in your Hardhat project using Chainlink Local. These guides cover different environments to suit your testing needs.

## Guides

### [Using CCIP Local Simulator in Your Hardhat Project](/chainlink-local/build/ccip/hardhat/local-simulator)

This guide helps you set up and run CCIP in a localhost environment within your Hardhat project. It provides step-by-step instructions on cloning the CCIP Hardhat Starter Kit, installing necessary dependencies, and running tests for token transfers between two accounts. This is ideal for initial development and testing in an isolated environment.

### [Using CCIP Local Simulator in Your Hardhat Project - Forked Environments](/chainlink-local/build/ccip/hardhat/local-simulator-fork)

This guide extends your testing capabilities by demonstrating how to use the CCIP Local Simulator in a forked environment. It includes instructions on setting up forks of real blockchain networks (e.g., _Arbitrum Sepolia_ and _Ethereum Sepolia_), preparing scenarios, and running tests to simulate cross-chain token transfers. This guide is ideal for testing in a more realistic, yet controlled, setting.
