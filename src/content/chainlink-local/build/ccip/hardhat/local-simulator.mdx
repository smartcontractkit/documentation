You can use Chainlink Local to run CCIP in a localhost environment within your Hardhat project. To get started quickly, you will use the
[CCIP Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-hardhat). This project is a Hardhat boilerplate that includes the
Chainlink Local package and several CCIP examples.

## Prerequisites

1. In a terminal, clone the [CCIP Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-hardhat) repository and change directories:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-hardhat && \
   cd ./ccip-starter-kit-hardhat/
   ```

1. Install the [Chainlink Local](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local) package and other required packages:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

1. Compile the contracts:

   ```shell
   npm run compile
   ```

## Test tokens transfers

You will run a test to transfer tokens between two accounts. The test file `Example1.spec.ts` is located in the `./test/no-fork` directory.
This file contains one test case:

**Transfer with LINK fees**: This test case transfers tokens from the sender account to the receiver account, paying fees in LINK. At the end of the test,
it verifies that the sender account was debited and the receiver account was credited.

For a detailed explanation of the test file, refer to the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section.

In your terminal, run the following command to execute the test:

    ```shell
    npx hardhat test test/no-fork/Example1.spec.ts
    ```

Example output:

      ```text
      $ npx hardhat test test/no-fork/Example1.spec.ts


      Example 1
         âœ” Should transfer CCIP test tokens from EOA to EOA (1057ms)


      1 passing (1s)
      ```

## Examine the code

### Setup

To transfer tokens using CCIP, we need the following:

- Destination chain selector
- Source CCIP router
- LINK token for paying CCIP fees
- A test token contract (such as CCIP-BnM)
- A sender account (Alice)
- A receiver account (Bob)

The `deployFixture` function is used to set up the initial state for the tests. This function deploys the CCIP local simulator contract and initializes
the sender and receiver accounts.

1.  Initialize the [CCIP local simulator](/chainlink-local/api-reference/solidity/ccip/cciplocalsimulator#cciplocalsimulator) contract:

    ```typescript
    const ccipLocalSimualtorFactory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("CCIPLocalSimulator")
    const ccipLocalSimulator: CCIPLocalSimulator = await ccipLocalSimualtorFactory.deploy()
    ```

1.  Initialize the sender and receiver accounts:

    ```typescript
    const [alice, bob] = await hre.ethers.getSigners()
    ```

### Test case: Transfer with LINK fees

The `it("Should transfer CCIP test tokens from EOA to EOA")` function tests the transfer of tokens between two externally owned accounts (EOA)
while paying fees in LINK. Here are the steps involved in this test case:

1. Invoke the `deployFixture` function to set up the necessary variables:

   ```typescript
   const { ccipLocalSimulator, alice, bob } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)
   ```

1. Invoke the [`configuration`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/solidity/ccip/cciplocalsimulator#configuration) function to retrieve the configuration details for the pre-deployed contracts and services needed for local CCIP simulations.

1. Connect to the source router and CCIP-BnM contracts.

1. Call `ccipBnM.drip` to request CCIP-BnM tokens for Alice (sender).

1. Create an array `Client.EVMTokenAmount[]` to specify the token transfer details:

   ```typescript
   const tokenAmounts = [
     {
       token: config.ccipBnM_,
       amount: amountToSend,
     },
   ]
   ```

1. Construct the [Client.EVM2AnyMessage](/ccip/api-reference/client#evm2anymessage) structure with the receiver, token amounts, and other necessary details.

   - Use an empty string for the `data` parameter because you are not sending any arbitrary data (only tokens).
   - Set `gasLimit` to `0` because you are sending tokens to an EOA, which means you do not expect any execution of receiver logic (and therefore do not need gas for that).

   ```typescript
   const gasLimit = 0
   const functionSelector = id("CCIP EVMExtraArgsV1").slice(0, 10)
   const defaultAbiCoder = AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder()
   const extraArgs = defaultAbiCoder.encode(["uint256"], [gasLimit])
   const encodedExtraArgs = `${functionSelector}${extraArgs.slice(2)}`

   const message = {
     receiver: defaultAbiCoder.encode(["address"], [bob.address]),
     data: defaultAbiCoder.encode(["string"], [""]), // no data
     tokenAmounts: tokenAmounts,
     feeToken: config.linkToken_,
     extraArgs: encodedExtraArgs,
   }
   ```

1. Calculate the required fees for the transfer and approve the router to spend LINK tokens for these fees:

   ```typescript
   const fee = await mockCcipRouter.getFee(config.chainSelector_, message)
   await linkToken.connect(alice).approve(mockCcipRouterAddress, fee)
   ```

1. Send the CCIP transfer request to the router:

   ```typescript
   await mockCcipRouter.connect(alice).ccipSend(config.chainSelector_, message)
   ```

1. Verify that Alice's balance has decreased by the amount sent and Bob's balance has increased by the same amount:

   ```typescript
   expect(await ccipBnM.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.deep.equal(ONE_ETHER - amountToSend)
   expect(await ccipBnM.balanceOf(bob.address)).to.deep.equal(amountToSend)
   ```
