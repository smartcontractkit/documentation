In this guide, you will test the [Chainlink CCIP getting started guide](/ccip/getting-started) locally in RemixIDE. You will deploy a CCIP sender contract and a CCIP receiver contract, and interact with the local simulator to send data from the sender contract to the receiver contract.

## Prerequisites

[RemixIDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online development environment that allows you to write, deploy, and test smart contracts. By default RemixIDE does not persist the files that you open from an external source. To save file you will need to manually create a workspace and copy the files into the workspace.

1. Open the [RemixIDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your browser.
1. Create a [new workspace](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/file_explorer.html#new-workspace).
1. Copy the content of the [Test CCIP Local Simulator contract](https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol) into a new file in the workspace.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol" />

1. Copy the content of the [Sender contract](https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Sender.sol) into a new file in the workspace.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Sender.sol" />

1. Copy the content of the [Receiver contract](https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Receiver.sol) into a new file in the workspace.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Receiver.sol" />

At this point, you should have three files in your workspace:

      - **TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol**: The file imports the Chainlink CCIP local simulator contract.

      - **Sender.sol**: The file contains the Sender contract that interacts with CCIP to send data to the Receiver contract.

      - **Receiver.sol**: The file contains the Receiver contract that receives data from the Sender contract.

## Deploy the contracts

1.  Compile the contract.

    1.  In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Avalanche Fuji_.

1.  Deploy the `Sender.sol` contract.

    1.  [Open the `Sender.sol` contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Sender.sol) in Remix.
