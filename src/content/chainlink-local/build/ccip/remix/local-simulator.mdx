In this guide, you will test the [Chainlink CCIP getting started guide](/ccip/getting-started) locally in Remix IDE. You will:

- Deploy a CCIP sender contract
- Deploy a CCIP receiver contract
- Use the local simulator to send data from the sender contract to the receiver contract

## Prerequisites

[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online development environment that allows you to write, deploy, and test smart contracts. By default Remix IDE
does not persist the files that you open from an external source. To save files, you will need to manually create a workspace and copy the files into the workspace.

1. Open the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your browser.
1. Create a [new workspace](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/file_explorer.html#new-workspace).
1. Copy the content of the [Test CCIP Local Simulator contract](https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol) into a new file in the workspace.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol" />

1. Copy the content of the [Sender contract](https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Sender.sol) into a new file in the workspace.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Sender.sol" />

1. Copy the content of the [Receiver contract](https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Receiver.sol) into a new file in the workspace.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Receiver.sol" />

At this point, you should have three files in your workspace:

      - **TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol**: The file imports the Chainlink CCIP local simulator contract.

      - **Sender.sol**: The file contains the Sender contract that interacts with CCIP to send data to the Receiver contract.

      - **Receiver.sol**: The file contains the Receiver contract that receives data from the Sender contract.

## Deploy the contracts

1.  Compile the contracts.
1.  Under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, make sure _Remix VM_ is selected in the **Environment** drop-down list. Remix will use a sandbox blockchain in the
    browser to deploy the contracts.
1.  Deploy the [CCIP local simulator](/chainlink-local/api-reference/v0.2.3/ccip-local-simulator#cciplocalsimulator):

    1. Select the `TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol` file in the file explorer.
    1. In the _Contract_ drop-down list, select `CCIPLocalSimulator`.
    1. Click the **Deploy** button.
    1. The `CCIPLocalSimulator` is shown in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
    1. In the list of functions, click the [`configuration`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/v0.2.3/ccip-local-simulator#configuration) function to retrieve the
       configuration details for the pre-deployed contracts and services needed for local CCIP simulations:

       <ClickToZoom
         src="/images/chainlink-local/ccip/remix/cciplocalsimulator-configuration.jpg"
         alt="Remix IDE CCIP Local Simulator configuration"
       />

1.  You will interact with the LINK token contract to fund the sender contract with LINK tokens. The LINK token contract is pre-deployed in the local simulator
    configuration, so you can simply load the LINK token contract instance:

    1.  Select `LinkToken` in the _Contract_ drop-down list.
    1.  Fill in the _At Address_ field with the address of the `LINK` token contract from the `CCIPLocalSimulator` configuration.
    1.  Click the **At Address** button.

    The `LinkToken` contract is shown in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1.  Deploy the `Sender.sol` contract:

    1.  Select the `Sender.sol` file in the file explorer.
    1.  In the _Contract_ drop-down list, select `Sender`.
    1.  Under the _Deploy_ section, fill in the constructor parameters:
        - `_router`: The address of the `sourceRouter` contract from the `CCIPLocalSimulator` configuration.
        - `_link`: The address of the `LINK` token contract from the `CCIPLocalSimulator` configuration.
    1.  Click the **Deploy** button.

    The `Sender` contract is shown in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1.  Deploy the `Receiver.sol` contract:

    1.  Select the `Receiver.sol` file in the file explorer.
    1.  In the _Contract_ drop-down list, select `Receiver`.
    1.  Under the _Deploy_ section, fill in the constructor parameters:
        - `_router`: The address of the `destinationRouter` contract from the `CCIPLocalSimulator` configuration.
    1.  Click the **Deploy** button.

    The `Receiver` contract is shown in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

## Transfer data from the sender to the receiver

1. Fund the sender contract with LINK tokens to pay for CCIP fees:

   1. Copy the address of the `Sender` contract from the **Deployed Contracts** section.
   1. In the `CCIPLocalSimulator` contract, fill in the [`requestLinkFromFaucet`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/v0.2.3/ccip-local-simulator#requestlinkfromfaucet)
      function with the following inputs:
      - `to`: The address of the `Sender` contract.
      - `amount`: The amount of LINK tokens to transfer. For instance: <CopyText text="1000000000000000000" code/>.
   1. Click the **Transact** button.

1. Send data from the sender contract to the receiver contract:

   1. Copy the address of the `Receiver` contract from the **Deployed Contracts** section.
   1. In the `Sender` contract, fill in the `sendMessage` function with:

      - `destinationChainSelector`: The destination chain selector. You can find it in the `CCIPLocalSimulator` configuration.
      - `receiver`: The address of the `Receiver` contract.
      - `text`: The text to send. For instance <CopyText text="Hello!" code/>.

   1. Remix IDE fails to estimate the gas properly for the `sendMessage` function. To work around this, you need to set the gas limit manually
      to <CopyText text="3000000" code/>:

      <ClickToZoom
        src="/images/chainlink-local/ccip/remix/sendMessage-estimateGas.jpg"
        alt="RemixIDE CCIP Local sendMessage force gas limit"
      />

   1. Click the **Transact** button.

1. Check the receiver contract to verify the data transfer:

   1. In the `Receiver` contract, click on the `getLastReceivedMessageDetails` function.
   1. The `getLastReceivedMessageDetails` function returns the text sent from the `Sender` contract:

      <ClickToZoom
        src="/images/chainlink-local/ccip/remix/receivedMessage.jpg"
        alt="RemixIDE CCIP Local receivedMessage"
      />

## Next steps

You have successfully tested the CCIP getting started guide within a few minutes using Remix IDE. Testing locally is useful to debug your contracts and fix any
issues before testing them on testnets, saving you time and resources. As an exercise, you can try any of the
[CCIP guides](/ccip/tutorials) using the local simulator in Remix IDE.
