In this guide, you will test the [Chainlink CCIP getting started guide](/ccip/getting-started) locally in RemixIDE. You will deploy a CCIP sender contract and a CCIP receiver contract, and interact with the local simulator to send data from the sender contract to the receiver contract.

1. Deploy the [CCIP local simulator](/chainlink-local/api-reference/solidity/ccip/cciplocalsimulator#cciplocalsimulator) contract.

   1. [Open the TestCCIPLocalSimulator contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/TestCCIPLocalSimulator.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

   1. Compile the contract.
   1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Avalanche Fuji_.

1. Deploy the `Sender.sol` contract.

   1. [Open the `Sender.sol` contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Sender.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Sender.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

   1. Compile the contract.

   1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_
      in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Avalanche Fuji_.

1. Deploy the `Receiver.sol` contract.

   1. [Open the `Receiver.sol` contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/CCIP/Receiver.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/CCIP/Receiver.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />
