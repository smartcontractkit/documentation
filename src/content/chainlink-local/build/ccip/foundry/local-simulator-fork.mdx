You can use Chainlink Local to run CCIP in forked environments within your Foundry project. To get started quickly, you will use the
[CCIP Foundry Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-foundry). This project includes the `Example01ForkTest` file
located in the `./test/fork` directory, demonstrating how to set up and run token transfer tests between two accounts using CCIP in forked environments.

Forked environments allow you to simulate real-world blockchain networks by forking the state of existing chains. In this example, you will fork _Arbitrum Sepolia_
and _Ethereum Sepolia_.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you are familiar with the guide [Using the CCIP Local Simulator in your Foundry project](/chainlink-local/build/ccip/foundry/local-simulator).
If not, please get familiar with it and run all the prerequisites.

Set up an `.env` file with the following data:

- `ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) URL for the Arbitrum Sepolia network. You can obtain one by creating an account on
  [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) and setting up an Arbitrum Sepolia project.
- `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL for the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/),
  [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

## Test tokens transfers

You will run a test to transfer tokens between two accounts in a forked environment. The test file `Example01ForkTest.t.sol` is located in the `./test/fork` directory.
This file contains two test cases:

1. **Transfer with LINK fees**: This test case transfers tokens from the sender account to the receiver account, paying fees in LINK. At the end of the test,
   it verifies that the sender account was debited and the receiver account was credited.

1. **Transfer with native gas fees**: This test case transfers tokens from the sender account to the receiver account, paying fees in native gas. At the end of the test,
   it verifies that the sender account was debited and the receiver account was credited.

In these tests, we simulate transfers from a source blockchain (which is a fork of _Arbitrum Sepolia_) to a destination blockchain (which is a fork of _Ethereum Sepolia_). Forked environments allow you to simulate real-world blockchain networks by forking the state of existing chains, providing a realistic testing scenario.

For a detailed explanation of the test file, refer to the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section.

In your terminal, run the following command to execute the test:

    ```shell
    forge test --match-contract Example01ForkTest
    ```

Example output:

    ```text
    $ forge test --match-contract Example01ForkTest

### Setup

To transfer tokens using CCIP in a forked environment, we need the following:

- Destination chain selector
- Source CCIP router
- LINK token for paying CCIP fees
- A test token contract (such as CCIP-BnM) on both source and destination chains
- A sender account (Alice)
- A receiver account (Bob)

The `setUp()` function is invoked before each test case to reinitialize all the variables, ensuring a clean state for each test:

1. Initialize the source and destination forks:

   ```solidity
   string memory DESTINATION_RPC_URL = vm.envString("ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL");
   string memory SOURCE_RPC_URL = vm.envString("ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL");
   destinationFork = vm.createSelectFork(DESTINATION_RPC_URL);
   sourceFork = vm.createFork(SOURCE_RPC_URL);
   ```

1. Initialize the sender and receiver accounts:

   ```solidity
   bob = makeAddr("bob");
   alice = makeAddr("alice");
   ```

1. Initialize the [fork CCIP local simulator](/chainlink-local/api-reference/v0.2.3/ccip-local-simulator-fork#cciplocalsimulatorfork).

   **Note**: `vm.makePersistent` is used to make the `ccipLocalSimulatorFork` address persistent across forks:

   ```solidity
   ccipLocalSimulatorFork = new CCIPLocalSimulatorFork();
   vm.makePersistent(address(ccipLocalSimulatorFork));
   ```

1. Retrieve and set up the network details for the destination chain.

   **Note**: [`Register.NetworkDetails`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/v0.2.3/register#networkdetails)
   is a struct that stores network details (such as chain selector, router address, link address, wrapped native address, or CCIP test tokens), and
   [`getNetworkDetails`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/v0.2.3/ccip-local-simulator-fork#getnetworkdetails) pulls network details based on chain IDs:

   ```solidity
   Register.NetworkDetails memory destinationNetworkDetails = ccipLocalSimulatorFork.getNetworkDetails(block.chainid);
   destinationCCIPBnMToken = BurnMintERC677Helper(destinationNetworkDetails.ccipBnMAddress);
   destinationChainSelector = destinationNetworkDetails.chainSelector;
   ```

1. Switch to the source fork and retrieve the network details for the source chain:

   ```solidity
   vm.selectFork(sourceFork);
   Register.NetworkDetails memory sourceNetworkDetails = ccipLocalSimulatorFork.getNetworkDetails(block.chainid);
   sourceCCIPBnMToken = BurnMintERC677Helper(sourceNetworkDetails.ccipBnMAddress);
   sourceLinkToken = IERC20(sourceNetworkDetails.linkAddress);
   sourceRouter = IRouterClient(sourceNetworkDetails.routerAddress);
   ```

1. All the variables are stored in the contract state for use in the test cases.

### Prepare scenario (helper function)

The `prepareScenario()` function is invoked at the beginning of each test case. It performs the following actions:

1. Select the source fork and request CCIP-BnM tokens for Alice:

   ```solidity
   vm.selectFork(sourceFork);
   vm.startPrank(alice);
   sourceCCIPBnMToken.drip(alice);
   ```

1. Approve the source router to spend tokens on behalf of Alice:

   ```solidity
   uint256 amountToSend = 100;
   sourceCCIPBnMToken.approve(address(sourceRouter), amountToSend);
   ```

1. Create an array [Client.EVMTokenAmount](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#evmtokenamount)[] to specify the token transfer details. This array and the amount to send
   are returned by the `prepareScenario()` function for use in the calling test case:

   ```solidity
   tokensToSendDetails = new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](1);
   Client.EVMTokenAmount memory tokenToSendDetails =
       Client.EVMTokenAmount({token: address(ccipBnMToken), amount: amountToSend});
   tokensToSendDetails[0] = tokenToSendDetails;
   ```

1. Stop impersonating Alice (sender):

   ```solidity
   vm.stopPrank();
   ```

### Test case 1: Transfer with LINK fees

The `test_transferTokensFromEoaToEoaPayFeesInLink` function tests the transfer of tokens between two externally owned accounts (EOA) while paying fees in LINK.
Here are the steps involved in this test case:

1. Invoke the `prepareScenario()` function to set up the necessary variables:

   ```solidity
   (Client.EVMTokenAmount[] memory tokensToSendDetails, uint256 amountToSend) = prepareScenario();
   ```

1. Select the destination fork and record the initial token balance of Bob receiver:

   ```solidity
   vm.selectFork(destinationFork);
   uint256 balanceOfBobBefore = destinationCCIPBnMToken.balanceOf(bob);
   ```

1. Select the source fork and record the initial token balance of Alice (sender):

   ```solidity
   vm.selectFork(sourceFork);
   uint256 balanceOfAliceBefore = sourceCCIPBnMToken.balanceOf(alice);
   ```

1. Request 10 LINK tokens from the CCIP local simulator faucet for Alice (sender):

   ```solidity
   ccipLocalSimulatorFork.requestLinkFromFaucet(alice, 10 ether);
   ```

1. Construct the [Client.EVM2AnyMessage](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#evm2anymessage) structure with the receiver, token amounts, and other necessary details.

   - Set the `data` parameter to an empty string because you are not sending any arbitrary data, only tokens.
   - In `extraArgs`, set the gas limit to `0`. This gas limit is for execution of receiver logic, which doesn't apply here because you're sending tokens to an EOA.

   ```solidity
   Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
       receiver: abi.encode(bob),
       data: abi.encode(""),
       tokenAmounts: tokensToSendDetails,
       extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(Client.EVMExtraArgsV1({gasLimit: 0})),
       feeToken: address(sourceLinkToken)
   });
   ```

1. Calculate the required fees for the transfer and approve the router to spend LINK tokens for these fees:

   ```solidity
   uint256 fees = sourceRouter.getFee(destinationChainSelector, message);
   sourceLinkToken.approve(address(sourceRouter), fees);
   ```

1. Send the CCIP transfer request to the router:

   ```solidity
   sourceRouter.ccipSend(destinationChainSelector, message);
   ```

1. Stop impersonating Alice (sender):

   ```solidity
   vm.stopPrank();
   ```

1. Record Alice's final token balance and verify that it has decreased by the amount sent:

   ```solidity
   uint256 balanceOfAliceAfter = sourceCCIPBnMToken.balanceOf(alice);
   assertEq(balanceOfAliceAfter, balanceOfAliceBefore - amountToSend);
   ```

1. Call the [`switchChainAndRouteMessage`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/v0.2.3/ccip-local-simulator-fork#switchchainandroutemessage) function to switch
   to the destination fork and route the message to complete the transfer:

   ```solidity
   ccipLocalSimulatorFork.switchChainAndRouteMessage(destinationFork);
   ```

1. Record Bob's final token balance and verify that it has increased by the amount sent:

   ```solidity
   uint256 balanceOfBobAfter = destinationCCIPBnMToken.balanceOf(bob);
   assertEq(balanceOfBobAfter, balanceOfBobBefore + amountToSend);
   ```

### Test case 2: Transfer with native gas fees

The `test_transferTokensFromEoaToEoaPayFeesInNative` function tests the transfer of tokens between two externally owned accounts (EOA) while paying fees in native gas.
Here are the steps involved in this test case:

1. Invoke the `prepareScenario()` function to set up the necessary variables. (This function is the same as in the previous test case.)
1. Select the destination fork and record Bob's initial token balance. (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
1. Select the source fork and record Alice's initial token balance. (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
1. Begin impersonating Alice (sender) and provide her with native gas:

   ```solidity
   vm.startPrank(alice);
   deal(alice, 5 ether);
   ```

1. Construct the [Client.EVM2AnyMessage](/ccip/api-reference/v1.5.1/client#evm2anymessage) structure. This step is the same as in the previous test case.
   The main difference is that the `feeToken` is set with `address(0)` to indicate that the fees are paid in native gas:

   ```solidity
   Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
       receiver: abi.encode(bob),
       data: abi.encode(""),
       tokenAmounts: tokensToSendDetails,
       extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(Client.EVMExtraArgsV1({gasLimit: 0})),
       feeToken: address(0)
   });
   ```

1. Calculate the required fees for the transfer and send the CCIP transfer request along with the necessary native gas:

   ```solidity
   uint256 fees = sourceRouter.getFee(destinationChainSelector, message);
   sourceRouter.ccipSend{value: fees}(destinationChainSelector, message, fees);
   ```

1. Stop impersonating Alice (sender). (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
1. Verify Alice's (sender) balance. (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
1. Call the [`switchChainAndRouteMessage`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/v0.2.3/ccip-local-simulator-fork#switchchainandroutemessage) function
   to switch to the destination fork and route the message to complete the transfer. (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
1. Verify Bob's (receiver) balance. (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
