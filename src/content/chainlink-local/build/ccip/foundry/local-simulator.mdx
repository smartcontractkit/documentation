You can use Chainlink Local to run CCIP in a localhost environment within your Foundry project. To get started quickly, you will use the
[CCIP Foundry Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-foundry). This project is a Foundry boilerplate that includes the Chainlink Local
package and several CCIP examples.

## Prerequisites

1. In a terminal, clone the [CCIP Foundry Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-foundry) repository and change directories.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-foundry.git && \
   cd ./ccip-starter-kit-foundry/
   ```

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. This command installs the [Chainlink Local](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local) package
   and other required packages:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

1. Run `forge install` to install packages:

   ```shell
   forge install
   ```

1. Run `forge build` to compile the contracts:

   ```shell
   forge build
   ```

## Test tokens transfers

You will run a test to transfer tokens between two accounts. The test file `Example01.t.sol` is located in the `./test/no-fork` directory. This file contains two test cases:

1. **Transfer with LINK fees**: This test case transfers tokens from the sender account to the receiver account, paying fees in LINK. At the end of the test, it verifies that the sender account was debited and the receiver account was credited.

1. **Transfer with native gas fees**: This test case transfers tokens from the sender account to the receiver account, paying fees in native gas. At the end of the test, it verifies that the sender account was debited and the receiver account was credited.

For a detailed explanation of the test file, refer to the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section.

In your terminal, run the following command to execute the test:

    ```shell
    forge test --match-contract Example01Test
    ```

Example output:

    ```text
    $ forge test --match-contract Example01Test

## Examine the code

### Setup

To transfer tokens using CCIP, we need the following:

- Destination chain selector
- Source CCIP router
- LINK token for paying CCIP fees
- A test token contract (such as CCIP-BnM)
- A sender account (Alice)
- A receiver account (Bob)

The `setUp()` function is invoked before each test case to reinitialize all the variables, ensuring a clean state for each test:

1.  Initialize the [CCIP local simulator](/chainlink-local/api-reference/solidity/ccip/cciplocalsimulator#cciplocalsimulator) contract:

    ```solidity
    ccipLocalSimulator = new CCIPLocalSimulator();
    ```

1.  Invoke the [`configuration`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/solidity/ccip/cciplocalsimulator#configuration) function to retrieve the configuration details for the pre-deployed contracts and services needed for local CCIP simulations:

    ```solidity
    (
        uint64 chainSelector,
        IRouterClient sourceRouter,
        ,
        ,
        LinkToken linkToken,
        BurnMintERC677Helper ccipBnM,
    ) = ccipLocalSimulator.configuration();
    ```

         **Note**: The [`configuration`](/chainlink-local/api-reference/solidity/ccip/cciplocalsimulator#configuration) function also returns the destination router, WETH9, and CCIP-LnM contracts, but we are not using them in these test cases. Hence, there are commas in the return values.

1.  Initialize the sender and receiver accounts:

    ```solidity
    alice = makeAddr("alice")
    Bob = makeAddr("Bob")
    ```

1.  All the variables are stored in the contract state for use in the test cases.

### Prepare scenario (helper function)

The `prepareScenario()` function is invoked at the beginning of each test case. It performs the following actions:

1. Request CCIP-BnM tokens for Alice (sender):

   ```solidity
   ccipBnMToken.drip(alice);
   ```

1. Approve the source router to spend tokens on behalf of Alice (sender):

   ```solidity
   amountToSend = 100;
   ccipBnMToken.approve(address(router), amountToSend);
   ```

1. Create an array [Client.EVMTokenAmount](/ccip/api-reference/client#evmtokenamount)[] to specify the token transfer details. This array and the amount to send are returned by the prepareScenario() function for use in the calling test case:

   ```solidity
   tokensToSendDetails = new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](1);
   Client.EVMTokenAmount memory tokenToSendDetails =
       Client.EVMTokenAmount({token: address(ccipBnMToken), amount: amountToSend});
   tokensToSendDetails[0] = tokenToSendDetails;
   ```

### Test case 1: Transfer with LINK fees

The `test_transferTokensFromEoaToEoaPayFeesInLink` function tests the transfer of tokens between two externally owned accounts (EOA) while paying fees in LINK.
Here are the steps involved in this test case:

1. Invoke the `prepareScenario()` function to set up the necessary variables:

   ```solidity
   (Client.EVMTokenAmount[] memory tokensToSendDetails, uint256 amountToSend) = prepareScenario();
   ```

1. Record the initial token balances for Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver):

   ```solidity
   uint256 balanceOfAliceBefore = ccipBnMToken.balanceOf(alice);
   uint256 balanceOfBobBefore = ccipBnMToken.balanceOf(bob);
   ```

1. Begin impersonating Alice (sender) to perform the subsequent actions:

   ```solidity
   vm.startPrank(alice);
   ```

1. Request 5 LINK tokens from the CCIP Local Simulator faucet for Alice (sender):

   ```solidity
   ccipLocalSimulator.requestLinkFromFaucet(alice, 5 ether);
   ```

1. Construct the [Client.EVM2AnyMessage](/ccip/api-reference/client#evm2anymessage) structure with the receiver, token amounts, and other necessary details.

   - Set the `data` parameter to an empty string because you are not sending any arbitrary data, only tokens.
   - In `extraArgs`, set the gas limit to `0`. This gas limit is for execution of receiver logic, which doesn't apply here because you're sending tokens to an EOA.

   ```solidity
   Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
       receiver: abi.encode(bob),
       data: abi.encode(""),
       tokenAmounts: tokensToSendDetails,
       extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(Client.EVMExtraArgsV1({gasLimit: 0})),
       feeToken: address(linkToken)
   });
   ```

1. Calculate the required fees for the transfer and approve the router to spend LINK tokens for these fees:

   ```solidity
   uint256 fees = router.getFee(destinationChainSelector, message);
   linkToken.approve(address(router), fees);
   ```

1. Send the CCIP transfer request to the router:

   ```solidity
   router.ccipSend(destinationChainSelector, message);
   ```

1. Stop impersonating (sender):

   ```solidity
   vm.stopPrank();
   ```

1. Record the final token balances for Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver):

   ```solidity
   uint256 balanceOfAliceAfter = ccipBnMToken.balanceOf(alice);
   uint256 balanceOfBobAfter = ccipBnMToken.balanceOf(bob);
   ```

1. Verify that Alice's balance has decreased by the amount sent and Bob's balance has increased by the same amount:

   ```solidity
   assertEq(balanceOfAliceAfter, balanceOfAliceBefore - amountToSend);
   assertEq(balanceOfBobAfter, balanceOfBobBefore + amountToSend);
   ```

### Test case 2: Transfer with native gas fees

The `test_transferTokensFromEoaToEoaPayFeesInNative` function tests the transfer of tokens between two externally owned accounts (EOA) while paying fees in native gas.
Here are the steps involved in this test case:

1. Invoke the `prepareScenario()` function to set up the necessary variables. (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
1. Record the initial token balances of Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver). (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
1. Begin impersonating Alice (sender) and provide her with native gas to pay for the fees:

   ```solidity
   vm.startPrank(alice);
   deal(alice, 5 ether);
   ```

1. Construct the [Client.EVM2AnyMessage](/ccip/api-reference/client#evm2anymessage) structure. This step is the same as in the previous test case.
   The main difference is that the `feeToken` is set with `address(0)` to indicate that the fees are paid in native gas:

   ```solidity
   Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
       receiver: abi.encode(bob),
       data: abi.encode(""),
       tokenAmounts: tokensToSendDetails,
       extraArgs: Client._argsToBytes(Client.EVMExtraArgsV1({gasLimit: 0})),
       feeToken: address(0)
   });
   ```

1. Calculate the required fees for the transfer and send the CCIP transfer request along with the necessary native gas:

   ```solidity
   uint256 fees = router.getFee(destinationChainSelector, message);
   router.ccipSend{value: fees}(destinationChainSelector, message);
   ```

1. Stop impersonating Alice (sender) and verify the token balances for Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver). (This step is the same as in the previous test case.)
