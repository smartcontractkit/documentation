There are two comprehensive guides to help you test Chainlink CCIP in your Foundry project using Chainlink Local - one for each mode (with and without forking).
We recommend starting with the first guide (without forking) for initial development before advancing to the guide that demonstrates how to test in forked environments.

## Guides

### Using the CCIP Local Simulator in your Foundry project

This [guide](/chainlink-local/build/ccip/foundry/local-simulator) helps you set up and run CCIP in a localhost environment within your Foundry project. It provides step-by-step instructions on:

- Cloning the [CCIP Foundry Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-starter-kit-foundry)
- Installing necessary dependencies
- Running tests for token transfers between two accounts

Using the local simulator without forking is ideal for initial development and testing in an isolated environment.

### Using the CCIP Local Simulator in your Foundry project with forked environments

This [guide](/chainlink-local/build/ccip/foundry/local-simulator-fork) extends your testing capabilities by demonstrating how to use the CCIP Local Simulator in a forked environment. It includes instructions on:

- Setting up forks of real blockchain networks (such as Arbitrum Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia)
- Writing test cases
- Running tests for cross-chain token transfers between two accounts

Using the local simulator with forked environments is ideal for testing in a more realistic yet controlled setting.
