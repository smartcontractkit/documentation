**Chainlink Local** is an installable dependency that allows you to run Chainlink services locally. You can import Chainlink Local into your preferred local development environment,
including Foundry projects, Hardhat scripts, or the Remix IDE. Chainlink Local enables rapid exploration, prototyping, and iteration with Chainlink CCIP and data feed dApps
before transitioning to a testnet.

For instance, you can use Chainlink Local to execute CCIP token transfers and arbitrary messages on a local Hardhat or Anvil (Foundry) development node. Chainlink Local also supports forked nodes,
allowing you to work with multiple locally running blockchain networks using historical network states. User contracts tested with Chainlink Local can be deployed to test networks without modifications,
ensuring a seamless transition from local development to live testnets.

**Key Features of Chainlink Local:**

- **Local Simulation:** Run Chainlink services on a local development blockchain node, enabling fast and efficient testing and prototyping.
- **Forked Networks:** Work with deployed Chainlink contracts using multiple forked networks, providing a more realistic testing environment.
- **Seamless Integration:** Integrate with Foundry, Hardhat, and Remix IDE for a streamlined development process.

To get started with Chainlink Local, follow the installation and setup guide in the documentation. Explore the tutorials to see various use cases and examples
of how to use Chainlink Local for your development needs.
