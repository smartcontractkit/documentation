**Chainlink Local** is an installable dependency that allows developers to run Chainlink services locally. Developers can import Chainlink Local into their Foundry, Hardhat scripts, or RemixIDE. This enables rapid exploration, prototyping, and iteration of Chainlink products, such as Chainlink CCIP or data feed dApps, in your local environment. Developers can then move to testnet only when they are ready.

For instance, you can use Chainlink Local to execute CCIP token transfers and arbitrary messages on a local Hardhat or Anvil (Foundry) development node. Chainlink Local also supports forked nodes, allowing developers to work with multiple locally running blockchain networks using historical network states. User contracts tested with Chainlink Local can be deployed to test networks without modifications, ensuring a seamless transition from local development to live testnets.

**Key Features of Chainlink Local:**

- **Local Simulation:** Run Chainlink services on a local development blockchain node, enabling fast and efficient testing and prototyping.
- **Forked Networks:** Work with deployed Chainlink contracts using multiple forked networks, providing a more realistic testing environment.
- **Seamless Integration:** Integrate with Foundry, Hardhat, and RemixIDE for a streamlined development process.

To get started with Chainlink Local, follow the installation and setup guide in the documentation. Explore the tutorials to see various use cases and examples of how to leverage Chainlink Local for your development needs.
