## AggregatorV2V3Interface

[`AggregatorV2V3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local/blob/ba1f4636e657f161df634379a5057a5a394e2fbb/src/data-feeds/interfaces/AggregatorV2V3Interface.sol) combines the functionality of both AggregatorInterface and AggregatorV3Interface, providing backward compatibility while supporting newer Data Feed features.

<Aside type="note">

This interface inherits from both:

    - AggregatorInterface: Basic price feed functionality
    - AggregatorV3Interface: Extended Data Feed capabilities

</Aside>

## Interface Inheritance

```solidity
interface AggregatorV2V3Interface is AggregatorInterface, AggregatorV3Interface {}
```

This interface provides access to all functions and events from both parent interfaces.
