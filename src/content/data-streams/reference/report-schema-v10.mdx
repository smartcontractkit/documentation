### Schema Fields

| Field                 | Type     | Description                                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `usEquityPrice`       | `int192` | Last traded price from the real-world equity market                                 |
| `marketStatus`        | `string` | Status of the real-world equity market (e.g., OPEN, CLOSED, HALTED)                 |
| `stalenessTimestamp`  | `uint64` | Timestamp of the last update from the real-world equity feed                        |
| `tokenisedPrice`      | `int192` | 24/7 tokenized equity price as traded on supported exchanges                        |
| `currentMultiplier`   | `float`  | Currently applied multiplier accounting for past corporate actions                  |
| `reason`              | `string` | Reason for next corporate action (e.g., dividend, stock split, fee accrual, etc.)   |
| `activationTimestamp` | `uint64` | When the next corporate action takes effect (set to 0 if none is scheduled)         |
| `newMultiplier`       | `float`  | Multiplier to be applied at the activationTimestamp (set to 0 if none is scheduled) |

**Notes:**

- `usEquityPrice` updates in real time during market open, but may become stale during market closed periods.
- `tokenisedPrice` may continue to trade 24/7, and can diverge from `usEquityPrice Ã— currentMultiplier` when the market is closed.
- `currentMultiplier` reflects all past corporate actions and is updated only when a new action is activated.
- `activationTimestamp` and `newMultiplier` provide advance notice of upcoming corporate actions, allowing protocols to prepare.
- `reason` describes the type of upcoming corporate action (if any).
