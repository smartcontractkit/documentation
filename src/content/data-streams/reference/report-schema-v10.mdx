<Aside type="danger" title="Weekend Usage Disclaimer">
  **Users should not use these feeds during weekends** due to limited exchange activity.
  
  If usage is necessary, increase fees to mitigate risks. Developers are solely responsible for monitoring and mitigating market integrity risks, as outlined in the [Developer Responsibilities](/data-streams/developer-responsibilities) documentation.

**Notes:**

- Future Backed xStock streams may use different report schemas.
- `price` updates in real time during market open, but may become stale during market closed periods.
- `currentMultiplier` reflects all past corporate actions and is updated only when a new action is activated.
- `activationDateTime` and `newMultiplier` provide advance notice of upcoming corporate actions, allowing protocols to prepare.
- See more detailed guidance for handling stock splits in the [Best Practices](/data-streams/concepts/best-practices#handling-stock-splits-for-tokenized-assets) documentation.
