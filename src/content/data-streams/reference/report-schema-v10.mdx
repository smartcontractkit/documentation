**Notes:**

- `usEquityPrice` updates in real time during market open, but may become stale during market closed periods.
- `tokenisedPrice` may continue to trade 24/7, and can diverge from `usEquityPrice Ã— currentMultiplier` when the market is closed.
- `currentMultiplier` reflects all past corporate actions and is updated only when a new action is activated.
- `activationTimestamp` and `newMultiplier` provide advance notice of upcoming corporate actions, allowing protocols to prepare.
- `reason` describes the type of upcoming corporate action (if any).
