Crypto streams adhere to the report schema outlined below:

| Value                   | Type      | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feedID`                | `bytes32` | The unique identifier for the stream                                                  |
| `validFromTimestamp`    | `uint32`  | The earliest timestamp during which the price is valid                                |
| `observationsTimestamp` | `uint32`  | The latest timestamp during which the price is valid                                  |
| `nativeFee`             | `uint192` | The cost to verify this report onchain when paying with the blockchain's native token |
| `linkFee`               | `uint192` | The cost to verify this report onchain when paying with LINK                          |
| `expiresAt`             | `uint32`  | The expiration date of this report                                                    |
