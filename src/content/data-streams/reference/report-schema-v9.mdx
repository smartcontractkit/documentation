**Notes:**

- Future SmartData streams may use different report schemas.

##### `ripcord` Status

- 0 (false) - **Data Provider is OK**. This indicates that the Fund’s data provider and data accuracy is reporting as expected.
- 1 (true) - **Data Provider is flagging a Pause**. This indicates that the Fund’s data provider detected outliers, deviated thresholds, management or operational related pause. **During `ripcord=1`, do not consume any NAV data**.
