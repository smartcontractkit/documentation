**Notes:**

- Future 24/5 US Equities streams may use different report schemas.
- `lastSeenTimestampNs` helps applications detect stale data, especially important during market transitions and holidays.
- Market status cannot detect public holidays. See [Market Hours](/data-streams/market-hours) for major holiday periods.

##### Market Status Values

The `marketStatus` field reflects the current state of the equity market:

- **`0` (Unknown)** - Market status cannot be determined
- **`1` (Pre-market extended hours)** - Market is in pre-market trading session
- **`2` (Regular hours)** - Market is in regular trading session
- **`3` (Post-market hours)** - Market is in post-market trading session
- **`4` (Overnight)** - Market is closed overnight (between post-market close and next day's pre-market open)
- **`5` (Weekend)** - Weekend period (Friday 20:00 ET to Sunday 20:00 ET)

Users should implement appropriate safeguards based on market status, such as pausing trading, adjusting risk parameters, or implementing staleness checks during non-regular hours.
