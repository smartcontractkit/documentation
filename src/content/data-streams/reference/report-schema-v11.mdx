### Market Status Values

The `marketStatus` field reflects the current state of the equity market:

| Value | Status            | Hours (ET)                            | Description                                    |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `0`   | **Unknown**       | —                                     | Market status cannot be determined             |
| `1`   | **Pre-market**    | 4:00am–9:30am Mon–Fri                 | Extended hours before regular trading session  |
| `2`   | **Regular hours** | 9:30am–4:00pm Mon–Fri                 | Primary trading session with highest liquidity |
| `3`   | **Post-market**   | 4:00pm–8:00pm Mon–Fri                 | Extended hours after regular trading session   |
| `4`   | **Overnight**     | 8:00pm–4:00am Sun evening–Fri morning | Overnight session with limited liquidity       |
| `5`   | **Weekend**       | 8:00pm Fri–8:00pm Sun                 | Weekend period when primary markets are closed |

Users should implement appropriate safeguards based on market status, such as pausing trading, adjusting risk parameters, or implementing staleness checks during non-regular hours.

### Notes

- **IMPORTANT**: The `lastSeenTimestampNs` field reflects the timestamp of the last update for the `mid` price only. Do not assume this timestamp applies to `bid`, `ask`, `bidVolume`, `askVolume`, or `lastTradedPrice`. Different fields may have been updated at different times.
- `lastSeenTimestampNs` helps applications detect stale data for the mid price, especially important during market transitions and holidays.
- Future streams using this format may adopt different report schemas as needed.
- Market status cannot detect public holidays. See [Market Hours](/data-streams/market-hours) for major holiday periods.
- Data availability and sourcing vary by session. Liquidity is typically highest during regular hours and lower during extended and overnight sessions.
