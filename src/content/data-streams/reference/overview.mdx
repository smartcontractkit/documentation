### Data Streams API

Use the [Data Streams API](./data-streams-api) for applications that require high-frequency, verifiable data for **on-chain** execution. It provides access to cryptographically signed data reports that can be verified and used by smart contracts. This API is designed for applications that depend on low-latency, tamper-proof data.

### Candlestick API

Use the [Candlestick API](./candlestick-api) for **off-chain** applications. It provides historical open-high-low-close (OHLC) data and real-time price updates in a format compatible with the [TradingView data integration specification](https://www.tradingview.com/broker-api-docs/rest-api-spec/#tag/Data-Integration). This is ideal for building dashboards, analytics platforms, portfolio trackers, and research tools.
