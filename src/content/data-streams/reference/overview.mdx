Chainlink Data Streams offers two distinct APIs for accessing low-latency market data. Choose the API that best fits your use case.

### Which API should I use?

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Use Case**    | **Onchain** consumption by smart contracts                   | **Offchain** analytics, charting, dashboards               |
| **Data Format**         | Signed, verifiable data reports                              | Aggregated OHLC (candlestick) data                         |
| **Interfaces**          | REST API & WebSocket                                         | REST API (including a streaming endpoint)                  |

### Data Streams API

Use the [Data Streams API](/data-streams/reference/data-streams-api) for applications that require high-frequency, verifiable data for **onchain** execution. It provides access to cryptographically signed data reports that can be verified and used by smart contracts. This API is designed for applications that depend on low-latency, tamper-proof data.

### Candlestick API

Use the [Candlestick API](/data-streams/reference/candlestick-api) for **offchain** applications. It provides historical open-high-low-close (OHLC) data and real-time price updates in a format compatible with the [TradingView data integration specification](https://www.tradingview.com/broker-api-docs/rest-api-spec/#tag/Data-Integration). This is ideal for building dashboards, analytics platforms, portfolio trackers, and research tools.
