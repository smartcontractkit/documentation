The Streams Direct implementation provides direct access to Chainlink Data Streams through SDKs and APIs, allowing you to build custom solutions with low-latency, high-frequency data. This implementation enables you to fetch reports or subscribe to report updates from the Data Streams Aggregation Network and verify their authenticity onchain. For instance, you can use Chainlink Data Streams with the Streams Direct implementation to display indicative pricing offchain on your front end or with your bot to settle trades onchain.

## Key Features

- **Direct API Access**: Fetch data directly using REST API or WebSocket connections
- **Multiple SDK Options**: Choose between Go and Rust SDKs for seamless integration
- **Flexible Implementation**: Build custom solutions for both offchain display and onchain settlement
- **Onchain Verification**: Verify data authenticity when needed

## Getting Started

To implement Streams Direct in your application:

1. Review the [Architecture Documentation](/data-streams/architecture#streams-direct-architecture) to understand the system components
2. Choose your preferred SDK:
   - [Go SDK Documentation](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-go-sdk)
   - [Rust SDK Documentation](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-rust-sdk)
3. Follow our [API Tutorial](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct/streams-direct-api) to learn how to fetch and decode reports
4. Implement [onchain verification](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-onchain-verification) for your use case

## Common Use Cases

Streams Direct is particularly well-suited for:

- **Custom Trading Bots**: Build automated trading systems with direct access to high-frequency data
- **Front-end Price Display**: Show real-time indicative pricing in your dApp interface
- **Custom Settlement Logic**: Implement specialized settlement mechanisms using verified data
- **Market Analysis Tools**: Create tools for market analysis and monitoring

## Integration Options

### REST API

Use the REST API to fetch individual reports on demand. This is ideal for:

- One-time data queries
- Periodic updates at custom intervals
- Integration with existing REST-based systems

### WebSocket Connection

Subscribe to continuous updates via WebSocket for:

- Real-time price updates
- Streaming market data
- Immediate notification of new reports
