  **Users should not use these streams during weekends** due to limited exchange activity.
  
  If usage is necessary, increase fees to mitigate risks. Developers are solely responsible for monitoring and mitigating market integrity risks, as outlined in the [Developer Responsibilities](/data-streams/developer-responsibilities) documentation.
