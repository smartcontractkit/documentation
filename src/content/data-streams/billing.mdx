Chainlink Data Streams supports fee payments in LINK and in alternative assets, which currently includes native blockchain gas tokens and their ERC20-wrapped version. Payments made in alternative assets have a surcharge when compared to LINK payments. You pay to verify reports from Data Streams onchain using the verifier contract. The verification price depends on the Data Streams feed ID from which you verify a report. You pay per report verified. If you verify multiple reports in a batch, you pay for all of the reports included in that batch.
