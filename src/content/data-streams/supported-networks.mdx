Chainlink Data Streams provides data access directly via API or WebSocket for offchain use cases. It involves [verifying report integrity](/data-streams/tutorials/evm-onchain-report-verification) against onchain verifier proxy contracts.

Data Streams is available on any network listed on the following pages, where you can find the necessary Verifier Proxy addresses:

- [Cryptocurrency Streams](/data-streams/crypto-streams)
- [Real World Asset (RWA) Streams](/data-streams/rwa-streams)

## Streams Trade implementation (Onchain Lookup)

Streams Trade, the alternative implementation, allows smart contracts to access Data Streams onchain using the [`StreamsLookup`](/data-streams/getting-started) capability integrated with [Chainlink Automation](/chainlink-automation).

Streams Trade is currently available on the following networks:

- Arbitrum
- Avalanche
- Base
- BNB Chain
- Ethereum
- Optimism
- Polygon
