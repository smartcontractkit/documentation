Explore several tutorials to learn how to use the Data Streams.

## Fetch, Stream, and Decode Reports

- [Fetch and decode reports](/data-streams/tutorials/api-go): Learn how to fetch and decode reports from the Data Streams Aggregation Network, using the [Go](/data-streams/reference/go-sdk) or [Rust](/data-streams/reference/rust-sdk) SDKs.
- [Stream and decode reports (WebSocket)](/data-streams/tutorials/ws-go): Learn how to listen for real-time reports from the Data Streams Aggregation Network, decode the report data, and log their attributes, using the [Go](/data-streams/reference/go-sdk) or [Rust](/data-streams/reference/rust-sdk) SDKs.

<Aside type="note" title="Alternative to SDKs">
  If you prefer not to use the Go or Rust SDKs for your integration, you can find authentication examples in various
  programming languages on the [Data Streams Authentication](/data-streams/reference/authentication/) page. Combined
  with the [REST API](/data-streams/reference/interface-api) and [WebSocket](/data-streams/reference/interface-ws)
  reference pages, these examples can help you get started.

## Verify Reports

- [EVM onchain](/data-streams/tutorials/evm-onchain-report-verification): Learn how to verify onchain the integrity of reports by confirming their authenticity as signed by the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON).
- [Solana onchain integration](/data-streams/tutorials/solana-onchain-report-verification): Learn how to verify Chainlink Data Streams reports directly within your Solana program using Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) to ensure data integrity.
- [Solana offchain integration](/data-streams/tutorials/solana-offchain-report-verification): Learn how to verify Chainlink Data Streams reports client-side using the Rust SDK on Solana to ensure data authenticity before using it in your application.
