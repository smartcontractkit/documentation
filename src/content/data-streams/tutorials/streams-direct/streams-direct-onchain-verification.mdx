<DataStreams section="dsNotes" />

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to verify onchain the integrity of reports by confirming their authenticity as signed by the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). You'll use a verifier contract to verify the data onchain and pay the verification fee in LINK tokens.

<DataStreams section="asideDisclaimer" />

## Before you begin

Make sure you understand how to use the [Streams Direct](/data-streams#streams-direct-using-data-streams-with-your-own-bot) implementation of Chainlink Data Streams to fetch reports via the [REST API](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct-interface-api) or [WebSocket](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct-interface-ws) connection. Refer to the following guides for more information:

- [Fetch and decode reports via a REST API](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct/streams-direct-api)
- [Stream and decode reports via WebSocket](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct/streams-direct-ws)

## Requirements

- This guide requires testnet ETH and LINK on _Arbitrum Sepolia_. Both are available at [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia).
- Learn how to [Fund your contract with LINK](/resources/fund-your-contract).

## Tutorial

### Deploy the verifier contract

Deploy a `ClientReportsVerifier` contract on _Arbitrum Sepolia_. This contract is enabled to verify reports and pay the verification fee in LINK tokens.

1. [Open the ClientReportsVerifier.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/DataStreams/ClientReportsVerifier.sol) contract in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/ClientReportsVerifier.sol" showButtonOnly />

1. Select the `ClientReportsVerifier.sol` contract in the **Solidity Compiler** tab.

     alt="Chainlink Data Streams - Verify Report Data Onchain - Solidity Compiler"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Compile the contract.

1. Open MetaMask and set the network to _Arbitrum Sepolia_. If you need to add Arbitrum Sepolia to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#arbitrum-sepolia-testnet) page.

       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#arbitrum-sepolia-testnet"
     >
       Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and LINK token contract
     </a>

1. On the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab in Remix, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

     alt="Chainlink Data Streams - Verify Report Data Onchain - Injected Provider MetaMask"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. In the **Contract** section, select the `ClientReportsVerifier` contract and fill in the **verifier proxy address** corresponding to the Data Streams feed you want to read from. You can find this address on the [Data Streams Feed IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page. The verifier proxy address for the ETH/USD feed on Arbitrum Sepolia is <CopyText text="0x2ff010DEbC1297f19579B4246cad07bd24F2488A" code/>.

     alt="Chainlink Data Streams Remix Deploy ClientReportsVerifier Contract"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to ensure you deploy the contract to _Arbitrum Sepolia_.

1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Save this contract address for later.

   />

### Fund the verifier contract

In this example, the verifier contract pays for onchain verification of reports in LINK tokens.

Open MetaMask and send 1 testnet LINK on _Arbitrum Sepolia_ to the verifier contract address you saved earlier.

### Verify a report onchain

1.  In Remix, on the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, expand your verifier contract under the **Deployed Contracts** section.

1.  Fill in the `verifyReport` function input parameter with the report payload you want to verify. You can use the following full report payload obtained in the [Fetch and decode report via a REST API](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-direct/streams-direct-api) guide:

        ```
        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

1.  Click the `verifyReport` button to call the function. MetaMask prompts you to accept the transaction.

1.  Click the `last_decoded_price` getter function to view the decoded price from the verified report. The answer on the ETH/USD feed uses 18 decimal places, so an answer of `3257579704051546000000` indicates an ETH/USD price of 3,257.579704051546. Each Data Streams feed uses a different number of decimal places for answers. See the [Data Streams Feed IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page for more information.

## Examine the code

The example code you deployed has all the interfaces and functions required to verify Data Streams reports onchain.

<CodeSample src="samples/DataStreams/ClientReportsVerifier.sol" />

### Initializing the contract

When deploying the contract, you define the verifier proxy address for the Data Streams feed you want to read from. You can find this address on the [Data Streams Feed IDs](/data-streams/stream-ids) page. The verifier proxy address provides functions that are required for this example:

- The `s_feeManager` function to estimate the verification fees.
- The `verify` function to verify the report onchain.

### Verifying a report

The `verifyReport` function is the main function of the contract that verifies the report onchain. It follows the steps below:

- Fee calculation: It interacts with the `FeeManager` contract, accessible via the verifier proxy contract, to determine the fees associated with verifying the report.

- Token approval: It grants approval to the `rewardManager` contract to spend the required amount of LINK tokens from its balance.

- Report verification: The core verification step involves calling the `verify` function from the verifier proxy contract. This function takes the (unverified) report payload and the encoded fee token address as inputs and returns the verified report data.

- Data decoding and storage: In this example, the verified report data is decoded into a `Report` struct, extracting the report data. The extracted price data is then emitted through the `DecodedPrice` event and stored in the `last_decoded_price` state variable.
