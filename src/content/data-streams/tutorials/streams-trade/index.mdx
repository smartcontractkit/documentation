- [Getting Started](/data-streams/getting-started): Learn how to read data from a Data Streams stream, verify the answer onchain, and store it.
- [Handle StreamsLookup errors](/data-streams/tutorials/streams-trade/streams-trade-lookup-error-handler): Learn how to handle potential errors or edge cases in StreamsLookup upkeeps.

**Note**: Before implementing Streams Trade, ensure that Chainlink Automation is available on your desired network by checking the [Automation Supported Networks page](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks).
