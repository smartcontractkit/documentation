Chainlink Data Streams provides low-latency delivery of market data offchain that you can verify onchain. With Chainlink Data Streams, decentralized applications (dApps) now have on-demand access to high-frequency market data backed by decentralized, fault-tolerant, and transparent infrastructure.

Traditional push-based oracles provide regular updates onchain when certain price thresholds or update time periods have been met. Chainlink Data Streams is built using a new pull-based oracle design that maintains trust-minimization using onchain verification.

## Comparison to push-based oracles

Chainlink's push-based oracles provide regular updates onchain. Chainlink Data Streams operates as a pull-based oracle where you can retrieve the data in a report and use it onchain any time. Verifying the report onchain confirms that the data was agreed upon and signed by the DON. While many applications benefit from push-based oracles and require data only after it has been verified onchain, some applications require access to data that is updated at a higher frequency and delivered with lower latency. Pull-based oracles deliver these benefits while still cryptographically signing the data to ensure its veracity.

Additionally, pull-based oracles deliver data onchain more efficiently by retrieving and verifying the data only when the application needs it. For example, a decentralized exchange might retrieve a Data Streams report and verify the data onchain when a user executes a trade. A push-based oracle repeatedly delivers data onchain even when that data is not immediately required by users.

## Comprehensive market insights

Chainlink Data Streams provides price points such as mid prices and [Liquidity-Weighted Bid and Ask](/data-streams/concepts/liquidity-weighted-prices) (LWBA) prices. LWBA prices adjust dynamically based on the current state of order books, which offers greater insights into market liquidity and depth. Liquidity-weighted prices enhance trading accuracy, improve risk management, and increase transactional efficiency as they dynamically reflect the true market conditions based on volume and liquidity.

## High availability and resilient infrastructure

The Data Streams API services use an [active-active multi-site deployment](/data-streams/architecture#active-active-multi-site-deployment) setup as a highly available and resilient architecture across multiple distributed and fully-isolated origins. This setup ensures that the services are operational even if one origin fails, which provides robust fault tolerance and high availability.

## Use cases

Pull-based oracles allow decentralized applications to access data that is updated at a high frequency and delivered with low latency, which enables several new use cases:

- **Perpetual Futures:** Low-latency data and frontrunning prevention enable onchain perpetual futures protocols that can compete on performance with centralized exchanges while still using more transparent and decentralized infrastructure.
- **Options:** Pull-based oracles allow timely and precise settlement of options contracts. Additionally, Data Streams provides more detailed market liquidity data that can support dynamic onchain risk management logic.
- **Prediction Markets:** Higher frequency data updates allow for applications where users can act quickly in response to real-time events and be confident in the accuracy of the data used in the settlement.

## Data Streams implementations

### Streams Trade: Using Data Streams with Chainlink Automation

When combined with [Chainlink Automation](/chainlink-automation/introduction), Chainlink Data Streams allows decentralized applications to automate trade execution, mitigate frontrunning, and limit bias or adverse incentives in executing non-user-triggered orders.

Read more about the [Streams Trade Architecture](/data-streams/architecture#streams-trade-architecture) and an [example trading flow](/data-streams/architecture#example-trading-flow-using-streams-trade), or learn how to [get started](/data-streams/getting-started) with Streams Trade.

### Streams Direct: Using Data Streams with your own bot

Streams Direct offers a direct approach to integrating low-latency and high-frequency data into your applications. You can use the [Data Streams SDK](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-go-sdk) to fetch reports (REST API) or to subscribe to report updates (WebSocket connection) from the Data Streams Aggregation Network, and an onchain smart contract to [verify reports](/data-streams/reference/streams-direct/streams-direct-onchain-verification).

For instance, you can use Chainlink Data Streams with the Streams Direct implementation to display indicative pricing offchain on your front end or with your bot to settle trades onchain.
