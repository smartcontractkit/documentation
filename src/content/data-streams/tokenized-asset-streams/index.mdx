<Aside type="danger" title="Weekend Usage Disclaimer">
  **The `price` field does not update during weekends** because the underlying real-world equity market is closed.
  
  However, the `tokenizedPrice` field continues to update as it reflects trading activity on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Weekend liquidity tends to be thin, so users should implement guardrails against unexpected volatility.
  
  Developers are solely responsible for monitoring and mitigating market integrity risks, as outlined in the [Developer Responsibilities](/data-streams/developer-responsibilities) documentation.
