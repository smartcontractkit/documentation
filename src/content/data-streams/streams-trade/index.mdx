The Streams Trade implementation combines Chainlink Data Streams with [Chainlink Automation](/chainlink-automation) to enable automated trade execution. This implementation allows decentralized applications to automate trade execution, mitigate frontrunning, and limit bias or adverse incentives in executing non-user-triggered orders.

Read more about the [Streams Trade Architecture](/data-streams/architecture#streams-trade-architecture) and an [example trading flow](/data-streams/architecture#example-trading-flow-using-streams-trade).

## Getting Started

To implement Streams Trade in your application:

1. First, ensure Chainlink Automation is available on your desired network by checking the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks) page.
1. Review the [Architecture Documentation](/data-streams/architecture#streams-trade-architecture) to understand the system components.
1. See an [Example Trading Flow](/data-streams/architecture#example-trading-flow-using-streams-trade) to understand how trades are executed.
1. Follow our [Getting Started Guide](/data-streams/getting-started) to set up your first integration.

## Common Use Cases

Streams Trade is particularly well-suited for:

- **Perpetual Futures Protocols**: Enable high-performance onchain perpetual futures that can compete with centralized exchanges
- **Automated Market Making**: Implement sophisticated market making strategies with real-time price updates
- **Options Protocols**: Enable precise and timely settlement of options contracts
- **Prediction Markets**: Allow quick responses to real-time events with accurate settlement data
