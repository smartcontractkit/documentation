This guide outlines the best practices when using Chainlink Automation. These best practices are important for using Chainlink Automation securely and reliably when you [create Automation-compatible contracts](/chainlink-automation/guides/compatible-contracts).

### Use the latest version of Chainlink Automation

To get the best reliability and security guarantees for your upkeep, use the latest version of Chainlink Automation.

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation of older upkeeps">
  [Migrate existing upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/guides/migrate-to-v2) before **August 29, 2024**. Versions earlier
  than 2.1 are no longer supported, and existing upkeeps on versions earlier than 2.1 will stop being performed on
  August 29, 2024.
</Aside>

### Make registry and registrar addresses configurable

Where your upkeep calls the registry or the registrar, you must make the address configurable so you can migrate your upkeep easily with the one-click migration capability. If you don't make the address configurable, you must redeploy the upkeep for migrations.

Alternatively, set the forwarder address when your upkeep is deployed and read the registry from the forwarder during your execution to simplify it.

### Use the Forwarder

If your upkeep performs **sensitive** functions in your protocol, consider using the [`Forwarder`](/chainlink-automation/overview/automation-release-notes) to lock it down so `performUpkeep` can only be called by the `Forwarder`. Add other permissible addresses if you need to call it yourself. Note the forwarder is only determined after registration so make this a mutable variable and ensure you add a setter function with permissions for you to set it.

### Verify Data Streams reports fetched with StreamsLookup

If your upkeep uses [StreamsLookup](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#streamslookupcompatibleinterface), ensure you use the [verification interface](/data-streams/reference/interfaces) to verify your reports onchain.

### Avoid "flickering" custom logic upkeeps

The Automation DON evaluates your upkeep regularly. When your upkeep is eligible, the DON attempts to perform the upkeep. For best results, ensure that `checkUpkeep` remains true until execution.

If the state of your upkeep "flickers" by rapidly alternating between true and false, then your upkeep is at risk of not being performed. "Flickering" upkeeps might cause unintended consequences because there is latency between observing the state of the chain, getting consensus (v2 and later) on what needs to happen, and confirming the transaction onchain.

### Always test your contracts

As with all smart contract testing, it is important to test the boundaries of your smart contract in order to ensure it operates as intended. Similarly, it is important to make sure the compatible contract operates within the parameters of the `Registry`.

Test all of your mission-critical contracts, and stress-test the contract to confirm the performance and correct operation of your use case under load and adversarial conditions. The Chainlink Automation Network will continue to operate under stress, but so should your contract. For a list of supported testnet blockchains, please review the [supported networks page](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks).

### Using ERC-677 tokens

For registration on Mainnet, you need ERC-677 LINK. Many token bridges give you ERC-20 LINK tokens. Use PegSwap to [convert Chainlink tokens (LINK) to be ERC-677 compatible](https://pegswap.chain.link/). To register on a supported testnet, get [LINK](/resources/link-token-contracts) for the testnet that you want to use from our faucet.

### Automation v1 upkeep revalidation

If your upkeep is on Automation v1, we recommend that you revalidate the conditions specified in `checkUpkeep` in your `performUpkeep` function. Automation v1 uses a turn taking system where nodes rotate to monitor your upkeep. It does not use consensus.
