Automate your smart contracts using a secure and hyper-reliable decentralized network that uses the same external network of node operators that secures billions in value. Building on Chainlink Automation will accelerate your innovation, save you time and money, and help you get to market faster so you don't have to deal with the setup cost, ongoing maintenance, and risks associated with a centralized automation stack.

To learn more about how the Chainlink Automation Network automates your smart contracts, visit the [Concepts](/chainlink-automation/concepts/automation-concepts) and [Architecture](/chainlink-automation/concepts/automation-architecture) pages. You can also learn more through our [additional Automation resources](https://chain.link/automation#masterclass).
