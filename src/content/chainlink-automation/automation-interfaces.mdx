Your Automation-compatible contracts may use the following interfaces. You can find them in the [Chainlink repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/automation). To understand how to implement these contracts, visit the [Compatible Contracts page](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts).

- If you want a log event to trigger your upkeep, use the [`ILogAutomation`](#ilogautomation) interface.
- If you want to use on-chain state (excluding logs) in a custom calculation to trigger your upkeep, use [`AutomationCompatibleInterface`](#automationcompatibleinterface) interface.
- If you want to call a function just based on time, consider using a [time-based upkeep](/chainlink-automation/job-scheduler).
- If you want to use Automation with Data Streams, use [`StreamsLookupCompatibleInterface`](#streamslookupcompatibleinterface) interface.

## `ILogAutomation`

Below is an outline of function parameters for functions found in [`ILogAutomation.sol`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/interfaces/ILogAutomation.sol). To use log triggers, you will need to implement this interface in your smart contract. Click on the functions below to understand the parameters:

| Function Name                                               | Description                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`checkLog`](#checklog-function)                            | Simulates off-chain once a log that matches log specifications is emitted.             |
| [`performUpkeep`](#performupkeep-function-for-log-triggers) | Contains the logic that should be executed on-chain when `checkUpkeep` returns `true`. |

### `checkLog` function

`checkLog` is the initial `view` function that will be simulated off-chain once a log that matches log specification has been emmitted. It should parse the log data and trigger an action. For example, it can trigger the [retrieval of Data Streams reports](/chainlink-automation/streams-lookup#code-example).

#### Parameters

| Variable Name | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                           | Permissible Values                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `log`         | struct `Log` | Struct log data of the log triggering the upkeep; Automation will form the triggering log into a struct so the user can query log data in `checkLog`. | `struct Log { uint256 index; uint256 timestamp; bytes32 txHash; uint256 blockNumber; bytes32 blockHash; address source; bytes32[] topics; bytes data; }` |
| `checkData`   | `bytes`      | Optional additional bytes the user wants to provide. `checkData` is set at time of registering the upkeep.                                            |                                                                                                                                                          |

#### Example

```solidity
struct Log {
  uint256 index;
  uint256 timestamp;
  bytes32 txHash;
  uint256 blockNumber;
  bytes32 blockHash;
  address source;
  bytes32[] topics;
  bytes data;
}
...
function checkLog(
    Log calldata log,
    bytes memory checkData
  ) external returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData);
  {...}
```

### `performUpkeep` function for log triggers

This function contains the code that will be executed on-chain to finalize the trade.

#### Parameters

| Variable Name | Type    | Description                                                                                      | Permissible Values |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `performData` | `bytes` | Data encoded in the `oracleCallback` function that will be used to execute the function on-chain | bytes              |

## `AutomationCompatibleInterface`

[`AutomationCompatibleInterface.sol`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/interfaces/AutomationCompatibleInterface.sol) is used to create and register upkeeps using custom logic triggers. Click on one of the functions below to understand its parameters and limits.

| Function Name                                                        | Description                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`checkUpkeep`](#checkupkeep-function)                               | Runs off-chain at every block to determine if the `performUpkeep` function should be called on-chain. |
| [`performUpkeep`](#performupkeep-function-for-custom-logic-triggers) | Contains the logic that should be executed on-chain when `checkUpkeep` returns true.                  |

### `checkUpkeep` function

This function contains the logic that runs off-chain during every block as an [`eth_call`](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_call) to determine if `performUpkeep` should be executed on-chain. To reduce on-chain gas usage, attempt to do your gas intensive calculations off-chain in `checkUpkeep` and pass the result to `performUpkeep` on-chain.

#### `checkUpkeep` gas limits

The `checkUpkeep` function is subject to the `checkGasLimit` in the [registry configuration](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations).

Because `checkUpkeep` is only off-chain in simulation it is best to treat this as a `view` function and not modify any state. This might not always be possible if you want to use more advanced Solidity features like [`DelegateCall`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries). It is a best practice to import the [`AutomationCompatible.sol`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/AutomationCompatible.sol) contract and use the `cannotExecute` modifier to ensure that the method can be used only for simulation purposes.

```solidity
function checkUpkeep(
  bytes calldata checkData
) external view override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData);
```

Below are the parameters and return values of the `checkUpkeep` function. Click each value to learn more about its design patterns and best practices:

**Parameters:**

- [`checkData`](#checkdata): Fixed and specified at upkeep registration and used in every `checkUpkeep`. Can be empty (0x).

**Return Values:**

- `upkeepNeeded`: Boolean that when True will trigger the on-chain `performUpkeep` call.
- [`performData`](#performdata): Bytes that will be used as input parameter when calling `performUpkeep`. If you would like to encode data to decode later, try `abi.encode`.

#### `checkData`

You can pass information into your `checkUpkeep` function from your [upkeep registration](/chainlink-automation/register-upkeep) to execute different code paths. For example, to check the balance on an specific address, set the `checkData` to abi encode the address. To learn how to create flexible upkeeps with checkData, please see out [flexible upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/flexible-upkeeps) page.

<CodeSample src="snippets/Automation/checkData.sol" />

Tips on using `checkData`:

- **Managing unbounded upkeeps**: Limit the problem set of your on-chain execution by creating a range bound for your upkeep to check and perform. This allows you to keep within predefined gas limits, which creates a predictable upper bound gas cost on your transactions. Break apart your problem into multiple upkeep registrations to limit the scope of work.

  **Example**: You could create an upkeep for each subset of addresses that you want to service. The ranges could be 0 to 49, 50 to 99, and 100 to 149.

- **Managing code paths**: Pass in data to your `checkUpkeep` to make your contract logic go down different code paths. This can be used in creative ways based on your use case needs.

  **Example**: You could support multiple types of upkeep within a single contract and pass a function selector through the `checkData` function.

#### `performData`

The response from `checkUpkeep` is passed to the `performUpkeep` function as `performData`. This allows you to perform complex and gas intensive calculations as a simulation off-chain and only pass the needed data on-chain.

You can create a highly flexible off-chain computation infrastructure that can perform precise actions on-chain by using `checkData` and `performData`. Both of these computations are entirely programmable.

### `performUpkeep` function for custom logic triggers

When `checkUpkeep` returns `upkeepNeeded == true`, the Automation node broadcasts a transaction to the blockchain to execute your `performUpkeep` function on-chain with `performData` as an input.

#### `performUpkeep` gas limits

During registration you have to specify the maximum gas limit that we should allow your contract to use. We simulate `performUpkeep` during `checkUpkeep` and if the gas exceeds this limit the function will not execute on-chain. One method to determine your upkeep's gas limit is to simulate the `performUpkeep` function and add enough overhead to take into account increases that might happen due to changes in `performData` or on-chain data. The gas limit you specify cannot exceed the `performGasLimit` in the [configuration of the registry](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations).

Ensure that your `performUpkeep` is _idempotent_. Your `performUpkeep` function should change state such that `checkUpkeep` will not return `true` for the same subset of work once said work is complete. Otherwise the Upkeep will remain eligible and result in multiple performances by the Chainlink Automation Network on the exactly same subset of work. As a best practice, always [revalidate](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contract-best-practice#revalidate-performupkeep-on-automation-compatible-contracts) conditions for your upkeep at the start of your `performUpkeep` function.

```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override;
```

**Parameters:**

- [`performData`](#performdata): Data which was passed back from the `checkData` simulation. If it is encoded, it can easily be decoded into other types by calling `abi.decode`. This data should always be validated against the contract's current state.

#### `performData`

You can perform complex and broad off-chain computation, then execute on-chain state changes on a subset that meet your conditions. This can be done by passing the appropriate inputs within `performData` based on the results from your `checkUpkeep`. This pattern can greatly reduce your on-chain gas usage by narrowing the scope of work intelligently in your own Solidity code.

- **Identify a list of addresses that require work**: You might have a number of addresses that you are validating for conditions before your contract takes an action. Doing this on-chain can be expensive. Filter the list of addresses by validating the necessary conditions within your `checkUpkeep` function. Then, pass the addresses that meets the condition through the `performData` function.
  For example, if you have a "top up" contract that ensures several hundred account balances never decrease below a threshold, pass the list of accounts that meet the conditions so that the `performUpkeep` function validates and tops up only a small subset of the accounts.
- **Identify the subset of states that must be updated**: If your contract maintains complicated objects such as arrays and structs, or stores a lot of data, you should read through your storage objects within your `checkUpkeep` and run your proprietary logic to determine if they require updates or maintenance. After that is complete, you can pass the known list of objects that require updates through the `performData` function.

## `StreamsLookupCompatibleInterface`

To use Data Streams with Automation, your contract must be [Automation-compatible](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts) and include [`StreamsLookupCompatibleInterface.sol`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/interfaces/StreamsLookupCompatibleInterface.sol). This interface fetches and processes Data Streams reports. Click on the functions below to view their parameters and outputs.

		bytes memory performData = abi.encode(values, extraData)
		return (true, extraData);
	}
