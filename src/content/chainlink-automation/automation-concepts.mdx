Before you explore how Chainlink Automation works on the [architecture](/chainlink-automation/automation-architecture) page, you should explore core concepts.

**Prerequisites**:

- [Smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts#:~:text=DEFINITION,executed%20on%20a%20blockchain%20network.)
- [ERC-677 Token Standard](/resources/link-token-contracts)

## Upkeeps and triggers

These are the jobs or tasks that you execute on-chain. For example, you can call a smart contract function if a specific set of conditions are met. These specific conditions are called _triggers_. There are currently three types of triggers that the Chainlink Automation Network supports including:

- [**Time-based trigger**](/chainlink-automation/job-scheduler): Use a [time-based trigger](/chainlink-automation/job-scheduler) to execute your function according to a time schedule. This feature is also called the Job Scheduler and it is a throwback to the Ethereum Alarm Clock. Time-based trigger contracts do not need to be [compatible](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts/#example-contract) with the `AutomationCompatibleInterface` contract.
- [**Custom logic trigger**](/chainlink-automation/register-upkeep): Use a [custom logic trigger](/chainlink-automation/register-upkeep) to provide custom solidity logic that Automation Nodes evaluate (off-chain) to determine when to execute your function on-chain. Your contract must meet the requirements to be [compatible](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts) with the `AutomationCompatibleInterface` contract. Custom logic examples include checking the balance on a contract, only executing limit orders when their levels are met, any one of our [coded examples](/chainlink-automation/util-overview), and many more.
- [**Log trigger**](/chainlink-automation/log-trigger): Use log data as both trigger and input. Your contract must meet the requirements to be [compatible](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts) with the `AutomationCompatibleInterface` contract.

## Automation nodes

Nodes in the Chainlink Automation Network that service registered and funded upkeeps in the Automation registry. Automation Nodes use the same Node Operators as Chainlink Data Feeds.
