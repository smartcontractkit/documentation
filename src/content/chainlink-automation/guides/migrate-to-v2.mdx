Chainlink Automation 2.1 is a consensus-driven Automation solution that allows you to cut onchain gas costs by using cryptographically verified offchain compute. Automation 2.1 provides 10M gas worth of offchain compute, which is significantly more than previous versions. Additionally, Automation 2.1 provides increased reliability, performance, log trigger capability, and the ability to use `StreamsLookup` to retrieve Data Streams.

You can migrate most upkeeps that use Automation version 1.2 and later in the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/) or [in the block scanner](#migrating-upkeeps-using-block-scanner). When you migrate upkeeps through the registry, you retain the Upkeep ID. Before you migrate, read the [migration checklist](#migration-checklist) to maximize your benefits from Automation 2.1.

For upkeeps on older registry versions 1.0 (Ethereum Mainnet), and 1.1 (BNB Mainnet and Polygon Mainnet), you must migrate manually by cancelling and re-registering your upkeep in the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/). After you do this manual migration, future migrations will be easier because your new upkeeps will be eligible for the simpler migration process.

<Aside type="caution" title="Grant permission to the forwarder address">
After you migrate, your new upkeep has a [unique forwarder address](#unique-forwarder) to increase security. This address will be the unique `msg.sender` for your upkeep.

If your upkeep is restricted to a single address calling it, you must give permission to the forwarder address. Otherwise, Automation will no longer be able to execute your function.

## Migrating using the Chainlink Automation App

The Chainlink Automation App offers a streamlined migration process for upkeeps using registry versions 1.2 and later. To migrate upkeeps with older versions, follow the [manual migration process](#migrating-older-upkeeps-manually) instead.

1. Navigate to the Chainlink Automation App, select the supported blockchain you're using, and connect your wallet.

   <div class="remix-callout">
     <a href="https://automation.chain.link">Open the Chainlink Automation App</a>
   </div>

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/v2-migration/landing-page.png" />

1. To start migrating a specific upkeep, select the upkeep. In the **Details** page, expand the **Actions** menu and select **Migrate upkeep**.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/v2-migration/upkeep-details.png" />

   If you have multiple upkeeps to migrate, start the migration using the link in your upkeeps dashboard. This link displays only if you have one or more upkeeps to migrate:

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/v2-migration/1-bulk-migration-ui.png" />

1. Follow the prompts to approve and confirm the transactions in your wallet to migrate your upkeeps.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/v2-migration/approve-migration.png" />

   Upkeeps that are successfully migrated will show the following [transaction logs](https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x85b3a147518719d3c9b1dd6b80e5f39d53d18c177ebc10d1bfb8890eaab8900a#eventlog):

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/v2-migration/migration-txn.png" />

1. If your upkeep restricts `msg.sender` to the previous registry address, [update your contract](#update-permissions) to use the new forwarder address.

After the migration is complete:

- Your balance is transferred to the new registry automatically.
- The new forwarder address becomes available.
- Read the [migration checklist](#migration-checklist) to understand further updates you might need to make in your contracts.

### Migrating upkeeps on paused registries

If you have any upkeeps that are not yet migrated to v2.1, using older registries that are paused, the only action you can take is either to migrate these upkeeps or to cancel them. Affected upkeeps will show a **Deprecated** label in the Chainlink Automation App. When you hover over this label, it displays a link you can click to begin the migration process for the upkeep:

<ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/v2-migration/ui-deprecation-label.png" />

## Migrating upkeeps using block scanner

To migrate one or more upkeeps using the scanner:

1. Navigate to the blockscanner for the desired chain to the Automation registry containing your upkeeps. You can find the registry address in the Chainlink Automation App under **Upkeep details**.

1. Under **Contract/Write contract** expand the `migrateUpkeeps` function.

   Enter a list of upkeep IDs. For example: `[99297446083125056953495436926707926113001699970195513612134585638496630959874,63026166139768298778579034679995711427803187091626268721992534052921779884688]`.

1. Enter the destination registry address, which is the latest registry address on this chain. You can find this address on the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks) page, or at the top of the Chainlink Automation App with the desired chain selected.

1. Execute the `migrateUpkeeps` function and confirm the transaction. When this transaction is confirmed, your upkeeps will be migrated to the latest registry, and each upkeep will have a [unique forwarder](#unique-forwarder) address.

1. If your upkeep restricts `msg.sender` to the previous registry address, [update your contract](#update-permissions) to use the new forwarder address.

After the migration is complete:

- Your balance is transferred to the new registry automatically.
- The new forwarder address becomes available.
- Read the [migration checklist](#migration-checklist) to understand further updates you might need to make in your contracts.

## Migrating older upkeeps manually

For upkeeps on registry versions 1.0 and 1.1, you must migrate upkeeps manually:

1. Navigate to the Upkeep in the Chainlink Automation App.

   <div class="remix-callout">
     <a href="https://automation.chain.link">Open the Chainlink Automation App</a>
   </div>

1. In the **Details** section, navigate to the center **Upkeep** card. Copy the **Upkeep address** - you need this for Step 5.
1. Expand the **Actions** menu and select **Cancel upkeep**.
1. Approve the transaction in your wallet. When this transaction is confirmed, you must wait 50 blocks before you can withdraw funds.
1. Return to the main [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/) landing page. Register a new upkeep, providing the **Upkeep address** of your old upkeep.
1. If your upkeep restricts `msg.sender` to the previous registry address, [update your contract](#update-permissions) to use the new forwarder address.

After migration, you have a new upkeep on Automation 2.1 with the same interface as your old upkeep. Future migrations are eligible for the simpler migration process.

After the migration is complete:

- Your balance is transferred to the new registry automatically.
- The new forwarder address becomes available.
- Read the [migration checklist](#migration-checklist) to understand further updates you might need to make in your contracts.

## Update permissions

Your new upkeep has a new [unique forwarder](#unique-forwarder) to increase security for your upkeep. This address will be the unique `msg.sender` for your upkeep. If your upkeep restricts `msg.sender` to the previous registry address, you must give permission to the forwarder address. Otherwise, Automation will no longer be able to execute your function.

1. The forwarder address becomes available after migrating your upkeep. You can find this in the Chainlink Automation App, within the upkeep's **Details** section:

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/v2-migration/forwarder-address.png" />

1. Update your contract to use the forwarder address by following the instructions on the [Forwarder](/chainlink-automation/guides/forwarder) page.

### Forwarders by upkeep type

This diagram shows the flow of different contracts that Automation 2.1 deploys for new and migrated upkeeps. Compared to custom logic and log trigger upkeeps, time-based upkeeps have an additional contract:

<ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/v2-migration/v2-upkeeps-by-type.png" />

- For custom logic and log trigger upkeeps, the `msg.sender` in relation to your contract is the unique forwarder that Automation deploys when you migrate your upkeep.
- For time-based upkeeps, Automation deploys a unique forwarder and a unique CRON upkeep contract. In this case, the CRON upkeep contract is the `msg.sender` in relation to your contract.

## Migration checklist

Before you migrate, be aware of several important changes listed here.

### Unique forwarder

Automation 2.1 upkeeps are called from a unique forwarder per upkeep and not from the registry. If your upkeep restricts `msg.sender` to the previous registry address, you must update it to the newly created [forwarder address](/chainlink-automation/guides/forwarder). The forwarder address becomes available only after the upkeep has been migrated. This forwarder address will remain constant in future migrations.

### Update programmatic upkeeps

Note that migration moves upkeeps from one registry to another. If you interact with your upkeep programatically using Solidity or other interfaces, you must update your code to make sure that you are referencing the correct registry and registrar for your migrated upkeeps:

- Update the registry and registrar addresses.
- Ensure you use the latest version of the ABI for the registry and registrar.

#### Get the latest ABI

The latest ABI for Automation 2.1 is in the [@chainlink npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts?activeTab=code):

- Registry ABI: `@chainlink/contracts/abi/v0.8/IKeeperRegistryMaster.json`
- Registrar ABI: `@chainlink/contracts/abi/v0.8/AutomationRegistrar2_1.json`

After updating to the latest ABI, you will able to execute `registry.getForwarder(upkeepID)` to get the forwarder address in Solidity.

#### Check function signatures

If your contract makes function calls to the registry from your upkeep contract, follow the latest ABI.

### Funding is moved with migration

When you migrate, your LINK funding is moved from one registry to the next automatically.
