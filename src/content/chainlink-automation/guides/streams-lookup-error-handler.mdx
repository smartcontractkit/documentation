  Chainlink Data Streams is available on Arbitrum Mainnet and Arbitrum Sepolia. [Contact
  us](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/datastreams?#ref_id=docs) to talk to an expert about integrating Chainlink
  Data Streams with your applications.

The Chainlink Automation StreamsLookup error handler provides insight into potential errors or edge cases in StreamsLookup upkeeps. The table below outlines a range of error codes and the behavior associated with the codes. Use the `checkErrorHandler` function to specify how you want to respond to the error codes. `checkErrorHandler` is simulated offchain and determines what action for Automation to take onchain in `performUpkeep`.

<Aside type="caution" title="Developer responsibility">
  Developers implementing Chainlink products are solely responsible for maintaining the security and user experience of
  their applications. Developers must monitor and mitigate any potential application code risks that may, among other
  things, result in unanticipated application behavior, including by instituting requisite [risk mitigation
  processes](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#risk-mitigation) including, but not limited to, data quality checks,
  circuit breakers, and appropriate contingency logic for their use case.

## Error handler

When Automation detects an event, it runs the `checkLog` function, which includes a [StreamsLookup revert](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#streamslookup-revert) custom error. The StreamsLookup revert enables your upkeep to fetch a report from Data Streams. If reports are fetched successfully, the [`checkCallback`](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#checkcallback-function) function is evaluated offchain. Otherwise, the `checkErrorHandler` function is evaluated offchain to determine what Automation should do next. Both of these functions have the same output types (`bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData`), which Automation uses to run `performUpkeep` onchain. The [example code](#example-code) also shows each function outlined in the diagram below:

If the Automation network fails to get the requested reports, an error code is sent to the `checkErrorHandler` function in your contract. If your contract doesn't have the `checkErrorHandler` function, nothing will happen. If your contract has the `checkErrorHandler` function, it is evaluated offchain to determine what to do next. For example, you could intercept or ignore certain errors and decide not to run `performUpkeep` in those cases, in order to save time and gas. For other errors, you can execute an alternative path within `performUpkeep`, and the upkeep runs the custom logic you define in your `performUpkeep` function to handle those errors.

1. Add the `checkErrorHandler` function in your contract to specify how you want to handle [error codes](#error-codes). For example, you could decide to ignore any codes related to bad requests or incorrect input, without running `performUpkeep` onchain:

```solidity
function checkErrorHandler(
  uint errorCode,
  bytes calldata extraData
) external returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData) {
  // Add custom logic to handle errors offchain here
  bool _upkeepNeeded = true;
  bool success = false;
  bool isError = true;
  if (errorCode == 800400) {
    // Handle bad request error code offchain
    _upkeepNeeded = false;
  } else {
    // logic to handle other errors
  }
  return (_upkeepNeeded, abi.encode(isError, abi.encode(errorCode, extraData, success)));
}
```

1. Define custom logic for the alternative path within `performUpkeep`, to handle any error codes you did not intercept offchain in `checkErrorHandler`:

```solidity
// function will be performed on-chain
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external {
  // Decode incoming performData
  (bool isError, bytes payload) = abi.decode(performData)

  // Unpacking the errorCode from checkErrorHandler
  if (isError){
    (uint errorCode, bytes memory extraData, bool reportSuccess) = abi.decode(
    payload,
    (uint, bytes, bool)

    // Define custom logic here to handle error codes onchain
  );
  } else {
    // Otherwise unpacking info from checkCallback
    (bytes[] memory signedReports, bytes memory extraData, bool reportSuccess) = abi.decode(
      payload,
      (bytes[], bytes, bool)
    );
    if (reportSuccess) {
    bytes memory report = signedReports[0];

    (, bytes memory reportData) = abi.decode(report, (bytes32[3], bytes));

    // Logic to verify and decode report
    } else {
      // Logic in case reports were not pulled successfully
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing checkErrorHandler

`checkErrorHandler` is simulated offchain. When `upkeepNeeded` returns `true`, Automation runs `performUpkeep` onchain using the `performData` from `checkErrorHandler`. If the `checkErrorHandler` function itself reverts, `performUpkeep` does not run.

If you need to force errors in StreamsLookup while testing, you can try the following methods:

- Specifying an incorrect `feedID` to force error code 800400 (`ErrCodeStreamsBadRequest`)
- Specifying a future timestamp to force error code 808206 (where partial content is received) for both single `feedID` and bulk `feedID` requests
- Specifying old timestamps for reports not available anymore yields either error code 808504 (no response) or 808600 (bad response), depending on which service calls the timeout request

If your [StreamsLookup revert](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#streamslookup-revert) function is defined incorrectly in your smart contracts, the nodes will not be able to decode it.
