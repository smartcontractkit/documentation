Create powerful smart contracts that use log data as both trigger and input. This guide explains how to create log-trigger upkeeps.

<Aside type="tip" title="Testing and best practices">
  Follow the [best practices](/chainlink-automation/concepts/best-practice) when creating a compatible contract and test
  your upkeep on a testnet before deploying it to a mainnet.
</Aside>

## Understanding maximum logs processed

Chainlink Automation processes a limited number of logs per block per upkeep. See the [Concepts](/chainlink-automation/concepts/automation-concepts#maximum-logs-processed-for-log-trigger-upkeeps) page to learn about how logs are processed and how many logs you can expect to be processed per block on the chain you're using.

## Emit a log

1. Open `CountEmitLog.sol` in Remix. This contract contains an event `WantsToCount` that keeps track of the address of the message sender. The function `emitCountLog` emits this event.

{" "}

<CodeSample src="samples/Automation/CountEmitLog.sol" />

1. Under _Environment_, select the option **Injected Provider** to connect to your cryptocurrency wallet.
1. Deploy the contract and confirm the transaction.
1. You can view the contract on Etherscan by clicking the message in the terminal. You an view the address of the created contract and the original contract in Etherscan.
   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/log-trig-addresses.png" />
1. Navigate to the _Contract_ tab. If the contract is already verified, you will see options to **Read Contract** and **Write Contract**. If your contract isn't verified, follow the prompts in Etherscan to verify the contract.
1. Click **Write Contract** and click the **emitCountLog** button to emit a log.
1. Navigate back to Etherscan and locate the _Events_ tab. You should see the event of emitting a log recorded in this section.

## Using `ILogAutomation` Interface

1. Open `CountWithLog.sol` in Remix. This contract contains a struct to account for the log structure and uses the [ILogAutomation interface](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces#ilogautomation) for log automation. The interface contains the `checkLog` and `performUpkeep` functions. The contract contains an event `CountedBy`. The `counted` variable will be incremented when `performUpkeep` is called.

{" "}

<CodeSample src="samples/Automation/CountWithLog.sol" />

1. Deploy the contract and confirm your transaction.
1. Under _Deployed Contracts_, expand `CountWithLog`. Click the **count** button to view the value of the count variable. It should be 0.
   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/log-trig-count-0.png" />
1. Copy the address of this contract either via Remix or Etherscan to register it on the Chainlink Automation app.

## Using the Chainlink Automation App

<div class="remix-callout">
  <a href="https://automation.chain.link">Open the Chainlink Automation App</a>
</div>

**Click the Register New Upkeep button.**

    <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/auto-ui-home.png" />

### Connecting your wallet

If you do not already have a wallet connected with the Chainlink Automation network, the interface will prompt you to do so. Click the **Connect Wallet** button and follow the remaining prompts to connect your wallet to one of the [Automation supported blockchain networks](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks).

<ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/auto-ui-wallet.png" />

## Trigger selection

Select **Log Trigger**.

    <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/ui_select_trigger.png" />

## Using log triggers

<Aside type="tip" title="Reorg protection">
  Your upkeeps will be protected against logs that are emitted during a reorg.
</Aside>

1. **Provide the address of your [Automation-compatible contract](/chainlink-automation/guides/compatible-contracts)** that you want to automate. In this case, we will paste the address of `CountWithLog.sol`. This contract must follow the format of the [ILogAutomation interface](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/interfaces/ILogAutomation.sol) to ensure Automation nodes can interact with your contract as expected.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/log_trig_1_upkeep_address.png" />

1. **Provide the address of the contract that will be emitting the log.** In this case, this is the address of `CountEmitLog.sol`. If the contract is not validated you will need to provide the ABI.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/log_trig_2_emitter_address.png" />

   To find the ABI of your contract in Remix, navigate to the Compiler view using the left side icons. Then, copy the ABI to your clipboard using the button at the bottom of the panel.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/log-trig-ebi.png" />

1. **Use the dropdown to select the triggering event.** This is **WantsToCount**. You can also provide one optional filter per any of the indexed events in the log, but you don't have to. When this combination of filters are matched the upkeep will trigger.

## Entering upkeep details

Provide the following information in the Automation app:

    - **Upkeep name**: This will be visible in the Chainlink Automation app.
    - **Gas limit**: This is the maximum amount of gas that your transaction requires to execute on chain. This limit cannot exceed the `performGasLimit` value configured on the [registry](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks/#configurations).
    - **Starting balance (LINK)**: Specify a LINK starting balance to fund your upkeep. See the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page to find the correct contract address and access faucets for testnet LINK. This field is required. You must have LINK before you can use the Chainlink Automation service.

      {" "}

      <Aside type="tip" title="Funding Upkeep">
        You should fund your contract with more LINK that you anticipate you will need. The network will not check or
        perform your Upkeep if your balance is too low based on current exchange rates. View the [Automation
        economics](/chainlink-automation/overview/automation-economics) page to learn more about the cost of using
        Chainlink Automation.
      </Aside>

           {/* prettier-ignore */}

      {" "}

      <Aside type="tip" title="ERC-677 Link">
        For funding on Mainnet, you need ERC-677 LINK. Many token bridges give you ERC-20 LINK tokens. Use PegSwap to
        [convert Chainlink tokens (LINK) to be ERC-677 compatible](https://pegswap.chain.link/). Use [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) to get testnet LINK.
      </Aside>

    - **Check data**: Optional input field that you may use depending on whether you are using it in your contract.
    - **Your email address (optional)**: This email address will be used to send you an email notification when your upkeep is underfunded.

## Complete upkeep registration

Click **Register upkeep** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
![Upkeep Registration Success Message](/images/automation/automation-registration-submitted.png)

Your upkeeps will be displayed in your list of **Active Upkeeps**. You must monitor the balance of your upkeep. If the balance drops below the **minimum balance**, the Chainlink Automation Network will not perform the Upkeep. See [Managing Upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/guides/manage-upkeeps) to learn how to manage your upkeeps.

<ClickToZoom src="/images/automation/log-trig-config.png" />

## Performing upkeep

Navigate back to the Etherscan page for `CountEmitLog.sol`. Under _Write Contract_, click the button to **emitCountLog**. Refresh the upkeep details page. You may have to wait a few moments. Under _History_, you should see the upkeep has been performed.
