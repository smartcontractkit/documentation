This tutorial explains how to use the `Forwarder` to add additional security to your Automation upkeeps. To learn how other Chainlink Automation contracts work, click [here](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-contracts).

## What is a Forwarder? When is it used?

Starting with Automation 2.0, each registered upkeep under the Chainlink Automation network will have its own unique `Forwarder` contract. The `Forwarder` address will only be known after registration, as we deploy a new forwarder for each upkeep. The `Forwarder` contract is the intermediary between the Automation Registry and your Upkeep contract. The `Forwarder` will always be the `msg.Sender` for your upkeep.

If your `performUpkeep` function is open and callable by anyone without risk of accepting unintentional external data, you don't need to use the `Forwarder`.

## Securing your upkeep

If your upkeep's perform function needs to be permissioned, please consider adding `msg.sender = forwarder` at the top of your `performUpkeep` function.

To make this work you will need to:

- Create `forwarder` as a mutable address variable on your contract that only _you_ can update. `forwarder` is a unique value that cannot change for your upkeep.
- Create `setForwarder` function so you can update the `forwarder` address
- After registration run `setForwarder` with the forwarder address in your UI, or programmatically fetch it using `registry.getForwarder(upkeepID)` using the Registry interface.

## Code Example

The code sample below uses the Forwarder:
