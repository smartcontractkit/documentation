This guide explains how to register an upkeep from within your smart contract, also called programmatic upkeep creation. Your contract can then interact with it via the registry to get its balance, fund it, edit it, or cancel it using the `upkeepID`.

## Before you begin

Before beginning this process, complete the following tasks:

1. Ensure the smart contract you want to automate is [Automation Compatible](/chainlink-automation/guides/compatible-contracts). To learn more about the contracts Chainlink Automation uses, click [here](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-contracts).
1. Ensure you have sufficient LINK in the contract that will be registering the Upkeep. Use [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) to get testnet LINK.
1. Ensure you have the addresses for the LINK token you are using, and the correct registry/registrar. You can find these values on the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks) page. _Note_: You can retrieve the LINK token address by calling the function `getLinkAddress` on the registry .
1. Use variables for the registry and registrar addresses that your admin can change as new versions of Chainlink Automation are released.

1. The interface for LINK and Registrar for registration, interface for Registry for subsequent actions
1. Interface is like the API specification of interacting with the contract.

## Register the upkeep

Programmatically registering an upkeep happens in two steps:

1. Call the LINK token to give allowance to the Automation registrar for the amount of LINK you will fund your upkeep with at registration time, e.g.
   Pizza code to do
1. Call `registerUpkeep` on the Registrar contract using the `RegistrationParams` struct. You will receive the `upkeepID` if successful.

## Upkeep registration parameters and examples

Depending on the trigger you are using, the `triggerConfig` will be different. Browse the triggers below to understand how to set up `triggerConfig`.

### Custom logic upkeeps

#### Parameters

For upkeeps with triggers using onchain state only, the following parameters are needed:

#### Code sample

<CodeSample src="/samples/Automation/UpkeepIDConditionalExample.sol" />

### Log trigger upkeeps

#### Parameters

For upkeeps with triggers using emitted logs, the following parameters are needed:

```solidity
struct LogTriggerConfig {
  address contractAddress; // must have address that will be emitting the log
  uint8 filterSelector; // must have filtserSelector, denoting  which topics apply to filter ex 000, 101, 111...only last 3 bits apply
  bytes32 topic0; // must have signature of the emitted event
  bytes32 topic1; // optional filter on indexed topic 1
  bytes32 topic2; // optional filter on indexed topic 2
  bytes32 topic3; // optional filter on indexed topic 3
}
```

where filterSelector is a bitmask mapping and value is set depending on the selection of filters
| filterSelector | Topic 1 | Topic 2 | Topic 3 |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0 | Empty | Empty | Empty |
| 1 | Filter | Empty | Empty |
| 2 | Empty | Filter | Empty |
| 3 | Filter | Filter | Empty |
| 4 | Empty | Empty | Filter |
| 5 | Filter | Empty | Filter |
| 6 | Empty | Filter | Filter |
| 7 | Filter | Filter | Filter |
