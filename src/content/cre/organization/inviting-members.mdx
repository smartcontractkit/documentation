To collaborate with your team on CRE workflows, you can invite members to your organization. This guide walks you through the invitation process.

<Aside type="note" title="Organization ownership">
  The first person to create an account for your organization automatically becomes the **Owner**. Only the Owner can
  invite new members to the organization.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

- You must be logged in to <a href="https://cre.chain.link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cre.chain.link</a>
- You must be the Owner of your organization
- The email addresses you're inviting must belong to whitelisted domains

## Step 1: Navigate to Organization settings

In the left sidebar, click on **"Organization"**.

Enter the **name** and **email address** of the person you want to invite.

### Inviting multiple members at once

To invite more than one person:

1. Click the **"Add person"** button (visible in the screenshot above)
1. Enter the name and email for each additional person
1. Repeat as needed

## Step 5: Send invitations

Once you've added all the people you want to invite, click the **"Submit"** button in the bottom right corner.

<ClickToZoom

  alt="Submit button to send invitations"
  style="max-width: 150px;"
/>

The invited members will receive an email invitation to join your organization.

## What happens next?

After you send invitations:

1. **Email notification**: Each invited person receives an email with instructions to join your organization
1. **Account creation**: If they don't have a CRE account yet, they'll be invited to create one
1. **Automatic membership**: Once they complete account creation, they'll automatically become members of your organization—no additional acceptance step required
1. **Access**: They'll immediately have access to your organization's workflows and resources

<Aside type="note" title="Domain restrictions">
  The email addresses you invite must belong to domains that are whitelisted for CRE access. If an invited member's
  domain is not whitelisted, they won't be able to complete the account creation process.
