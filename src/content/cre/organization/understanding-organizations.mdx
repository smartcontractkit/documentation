## What is an organization?

A CRE organization is a collaborative workspace that allows multiple team members to deploy, manage, and monitor workflows together. When you create a CRE account, you either start a new organization (becoming the _Owner_) or join an existing one (becoming a _Member_).

An organization serves as a container for:

- **Multiple team members** with different roles (Owner and Members)
- **Linked wallet addresses** from all team members
- **Deployed workflows** visible to all organization members
- **Shared monitoring** of workflow executions and activity

Organizations enable teams to collaborate on CRE workflows while maintaining individual control over their own wallet addresses and secrets.

## Organization structure

### Single Owner model

Every organization has exactly **one Owner**—the person who first created the organization account. The Owner role:

- Cannot be transferred or changed
- Has full administrative control
- Can invite new Members to join
- Can link wallet addresses and deploy workflows

### Multiple Members

Members are users invited by the Owner to join the organization. Each member:

- Joins automatically after accepting the invitation and creating their account
- Can link their own wallet addresses to the organization
- Can deploy and manage their own workflows
- Views all organization workflows in the shared dashboard

### Shared visibility

All organization members can:

1. **View linked wallet keys** - Use `cre account list-key` to see all addresses linked to the organization by any member
1. **Monitor all workflows** - Access <a href="https://cre.chain.link/workflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cre.chain.link/workflows</a> to view:
   - All deployed workflows across the organization
   - Recent execution history
   - Workflow status (Active, Paused, Pending)
   - Execution success/failure metrics
   - Activity graphs and trends

## Organization roles

CRE uses a simple role-based access control system with two roles:

| Role       | Description                                           | Permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | How to obtain                                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**  | The person who first created the organization account | <ul><li>Full access to all organization resources and workflows</li><li>Invite new members to the organization</li><li>Manage organization settings</li><li>Deploy, activate, pause, update, and delete workflows</li></ul> | Automatically assigned when you create a new organization by signing up directly          |
| **Member** | Users invited to join an existing organization        | <ul><li>View all organization workflows</li><li>Link wallet addresses to the organization</li><li>Deploy and manage workflows under their linked addresses</li><li>Access workflow execution data</li></ul>                 | Invited by the Owner through the [invitation process](/cre/organization/inviting-members) |

**Key points:**

- There is only one Owner per organization
- Owner permissions cannot be transferred
- Only Owners can invite new Members
- Members automatically join after accepting the invitation and creating an account

  Additional roles with more granular permissions may be added in future releases to provide more flexible access control for larger teams.
