This page lists all EVM-compatible networks supported by CRE workflows, along with the minimum CLI and SDK versions required for each network.

## Version Requirements

Network support depends on your CLI and SDK versions. The tables below show the minimum versions required for each network.

- **New projects:** Run `cre update` to get the latest CLI, which includes compatible SDK versions.
- **Existing projects:** You may need to update your SDK dependency. See [Updating Dependencies](/cre/reference/project-configuration-ts#5-updating-dependencies) for instructions.

## Forwarder Addresses

For forwarder contract addresses and chain names, see the [Forwarder Directory](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/forwarder-directory). Forwarder addresses are used when building consumer contracts that receive workflow reports onchain. Learn more about [Onchain Write](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-write/overview).
