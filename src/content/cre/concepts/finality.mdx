Finality determines when a blockchain transaction is considered irreversible. Until a block is finalized, it could be reorganized (replaced by a different block if the chain temporarily forks), which means any data you read from it might change.

Different blockchains achieve finality in different ways and at different speeds. CRE abstracts these differences through **confidence levels**, allowing you to specify your finality requirements without needing to know the underlying chain-specific implementation.

You specify confidence levels in two places:

- **[EVM Log Triggers](/cre/reference/sdk/triggers/evm-log-trigger)** — The `confidence` parameter determines when the trigger fires based on block finality.
- **[EVM Client contract reads](/cre/reference/sdk/evm-client)** — The `blockNumber` parameter lets you query data from `LATEST` or `FINALIZED` blocks.

## Confidence levels

When reading from the blockchain or setting up triggers, you can specify one of three confidence levels:

| Confidence Level | Description                                                                         | Use Case                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`LATEST`**     | The most recent block. No finality guarantees—the block could still be reorganized. | Non-critical, time-sensitive operations where speed matters more than certainty. |
| **`SAFE`**       | A block that is unlikely to be reorganized, but not yet fully finalized.            | A balance between speed and security for most operations.                        |
| **`FINALIZED`**  | A block that is considered irreversible. This is the safest option.                 | Critical operations where you need absolute certainty the data won't change.     |

<Aside type="note" title="Default behavior">
  If you don't specify a confidence level, CRE defaults to `SAFE` for triggers and `LATEST` for contract reads.

### Choosing the right level

- **Use `FINALIZED`** when: Processing financial transactions, updating critical state, or when incorrect data could cause significant issues.
- **Use `SAFE`** when: You need reasonable confidence without waiting for full finality. Good for most monitoring and alerting use cases.
- **Use `LATEST`** when: Building real-time dashboards, price displays, or other applications where showing the most current data is more important than guaranteed accuracy.

## How confidence levels work per chain

Here's how CRE determines which blocks to use for each confidence level:

### SAFE and LATEST

When you specify `SAFE` or `LATEST` in your workflows, CRE uses the chain's native `safe` and `latest` block tags respectively for all supported chains.

### FINALIZED

- **Finality tag**: Uses the chain's native `finalized` block tag
- **Block depth**: Waits for a specified number of blocks to pass

| Chain                           | Finality Method | Block Depth |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Arbitrum One / Arbitrum Sepolia | Finality tag    | —           |
| Avalanche / Avalanche Fuji      | Finality tag    | —           |
| Base / Base Sepolia             | Finality tag    | —           |
| BNB Chain / BNB Testnet         | Finality tag    | —           |
| Ethereum / Ethereum Sepolia     | Finality tag    | —           |
| OP Mainnet / OP Sepolia         | Finality tag    | —           |
| Polygon / Polygon Amoy          | Block depth     | 500         |
