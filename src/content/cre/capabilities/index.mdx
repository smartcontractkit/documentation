At the core of the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is the concept of **Capabilities**. A capability is a modular, decentralized service that performs a specific task. Think of them as the individual "bricks" that you can use to build custom workflows.

Each capability is powered by its own independent Decentralized Oracle Network (DON), which is optimized for that specific task, ensuring security and reliable performance.

## Invoking Capabilities via the SDK

As a developer, you do not interact with these capability DONs directly. Instead, you invoke them through the developer-friendly interfaces provided by the **CRE SDKs** ([Go](/cre/reference/sdk/core-go) and [TypeScript](/cre/reference/sdk/core-ts)), such as the [`evm.Client`](/cre/reference/sdk/evm-client) or the [`http.Client`](/cre/reference/sdk/http-client). The SDK handles the low-level complexity of communicating with the correct DON and processing the consensus-verified result, allowing you to focus on your business logic.

## Available Capabilities

This section provides a high-level, conceptual overview of the capabilities currently available in CRE.

- **[Triggers](/cre/capabilities/triggers)**: Event sources that start your workflow executions.
- **[HTTP](/cre/capabilities/http)**: Fetch and post data from external APIs with decentralized consensus.
- **[Confidential HTTP](/cre/capabilities/confidential-http)** _(Experimental)_: Make privacy-preserving API calls with enclave execution, secret injection, and optional response encryption.
- **[EVM Read & Write](/cre/capabilities/evm-read-write)**: Interact with smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains with decentralized consensus.

All execution capabilities (HTTP, Confidential HTTP, EVM) automatically use [built-in consensus](/cre/concepts/consensus-computing) to validate results across multiple nodes, ensuring security and reliability.
