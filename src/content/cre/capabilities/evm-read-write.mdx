The **EVM Read & Write** capabilities provide a secure and reliable service for your workflow to interact with smart contracts on any EVM-compatible blockchain.

- **EVM Read:** Allows your workflow to call `view` and `pure` functions on a smart contract to read its state.
- **EVM Write:** Allows your workflow to call state-changing functions on a smart contract to write data to the blockchain.

## How it works

When you use the SDK's [`evm.Client`](/cre/reference/sdk/evm-client) to interact with a contract, you are invoking these underlying capabilities. This provides a simpler and more reliable developer experience compared to crafting raw RPC calls.

The SDKs simplify contract interactions with type-safe ABI handling (Go uses generated bindings, TypeScript uses viem), while the underlying CRE infrastructure manages consensus and transaction submission.

### Key features

- **Type-safe interactions**: SDKs provide type safety for contract calls (Go bindings offer compile-time safety, TypeScript uses viem for runtime type checking)
- **Decentralized execution**: Read and write operations are executed across multiple nodes in a DON with cryptographic verification
- **Decentralized consensus**: Multiple DON nodes independently verify read results and validate write operations before onchain submission
- **Chain selector support**: Target specific blockchains using Chainlink's chain selector system
- **Block number flexibility**: Read from finalized, latest, or a specific block number
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting for failed calls and transactions

<Aside type="note" title="EVM in simulation vs. deployed workflows">
**In local simulation**, the simulator makes real RPC calls to your configured endpoint.

**In deployed workflows**, the EVM capability DON executes contract calls across multiple nodes with decentralized consensus.

### Understanding EVM Write operations

For **EVM Write** operations, your workflow doesn't write directly to your contract. Instead, the data follows a secure multi-step flow:

1. **Your workflow** generates a cryptographically signed report with your ABI-encoded data
1. **The EVM Write capability** submits this report to a Chainlink-managed `KeystoneForwarder` contract
1. **The forwarder** validates the report's cryptographic signatures
1. **The forwarder** calls your consumer contract's `onReport(bytes metadata, bytes report)` function to deliver the data

This architecture ensures decentralized consensus, cryptographic verification, and accountability. Your consumer contract must implement the `IReceiver` interface to receive data from the forwarder.
