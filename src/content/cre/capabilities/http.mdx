The **HTTP** capability is a decentralized service that allows your workflow to securely interact with any external, offchain API. It can be used to both **fetch data from** and **send data to** other systems.

## Why use a Capability for HTTP Requests?

When your workflow needs to interact with an external API, the HTTP capability provides decentralized execution across multiple independent nodes.

When you use the SDK's `http.Client` to make a request (like a `GET` or a `POST`), you are invoking this capability. CRE instructs each node in a dedicated DON to make the same API request. The nodes' individual responses are then **validated through a consensus protocol**, which ensures they agree on the result before returning it to your workflow.

This provides cryptographically verified, tamper-proof execution for your offchain data operations.

<Aside type="note" title="HTTP in simulation vs. deployed workflows">
**In local simulation** (`cre workflow simulate`), HTTP requests are made from your local machine to test your API integrations. The simulator processes responses using single-node consensus.

**In deployed workflows**, the HTTP capability DON executes your API requests across multiple nodes, and responses are validated through Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus before being returned to your workflow.
