Before you can use CRE, you need to create an account. An account is required to log in with the CRE CLI and run any CLI commands, including [simulating](/cre/guides/operations/simulating-workflows) workflows.

There are two ways to create an account:

1. **Create a new organization**: Sign up directly on the <a href="https://cre.chain.link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRE UI</a>. You'll become the _Owner_ of a new organization.
1. **Join an existing organization**: Accept an invitation from an existing organization Owner. You'll become a _Member_ of that organization automatically after account creation.

This guide walks you through the account creation process for both scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- A valid email address
- Access to your email inbox to receive verification codes (and invitation email, if joining an existing organization)

## Step 1: Navigate to the CRE UI

There are two ways to begin the account creation process:

### Option A: Create a new organization

In this option, you'll create a new organization and become the _Owner_ of that organization.

Go to <a href="https://cre.chain.link/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cre.chain.link</a> and click the **"Create an account"** button.

### Option B: Join an existing organization

In this option, you'll join an existing organization and become a _Member_ of that organization.

If you've received an invitation email from an organization Owner, click the **"Accept Invitation"** button in the email. This will redirect you to the account creation page.

Only Owners can invite new members. Learn more about [Understanding Organizations](/cre/organization/understanding-organizations).
</Aside>

After choosing either option, continue with the following steps to complete your account creation.

## Step 2: Enter your information

Fill in the required information:

1. **Email address**: Enter a valid email address (if not already pre-filled)
1. **Country**: Select your country from the dropdown
1. **Terms and policies**: Review and accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

Click **"Continue"** to proceed.

## Step 3: Verify your email

<Aside type="note" title="Organization invitations">
  If you're joining an existing organization via an invitation link, **skip this step**. Your email is already verified
  when you accept the invitation, and you'll proceed directly to setting your password.
</Aside>

Check your email inbox for a message from Chainlink containing a 6-digit verification code. Enter this code in the verification screen and click **Continue**.

<Aside type="tip" title="Didn't receive the code?">
  If you don't see the verification email, check your spam folder. You can also request a new code by clicking "Resend
  Code" on the verification screen.
</Aside>

## Step 4: Set your password

Create a secure password for your account. Your password must meet the security requirements displayed on the screen.

  alt="Set password screen"
  style="max-width: 350px;"
/>

<Aside type="tip" title="Password best practices">
  Use a strong, unique password that you don't use for other services. Consider using a password manager to generate and
  store secure passwords.
</Aside>

## Step 5: Set up two-factor authentication (2FA)

To secure your account, you'll need to set up two-factor authentication. You'll be presented with two authentication method options:

1. **Fingerprint or Face Recognition** - Use biometric authentication on your device
1. **Google Authenticator or similar** - Use an authenticator app

<ClickToZoom

  alt="Choose authentication method"
  style="max-width: 400px;"
/>

### Using an authenticator app

If you choose the authenticator app option:

1. Click **"Google Authenticator or similar"**
1. Open your preferred authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password)
1. Scan the QR code displayed on the screen
1. Enter the 6-digit one-time code generated by your authenticator app
1. Click **"Continue"**

<ClickToZoom src="/images/cre/UI/account-creation/5-authenticator-app.webp" alt="Two-factor authentication setup" />

<Aside type="tip" title="Trouble scanning?">
  If you're having difficulty scanning the QR code, click "Trouble Scanning?" on the screen for alternative setup
  options.
</Aside>

## Step 6: Save your recovery code

Your recovery code is essential for regaining access to your account if you lose access to your authenticator device.

1. Copy the recovery code displayed on the screen
1. Store it securely in a password manager or offline location
1. Check the box "I have safely recorded this code"
1. Click **"Continue"** to complete account creation

  style="max-width: 350px;"
/>

<Aside type="caution" title="Keep your recovery code safe">
  **Never share your recovery code with anyone.** You'll need this code if you ever need to log in without your
  authenticator device. Store it in a secure location.
</Aside>

After completing these steps, you'll be redirected to your CRE dashboard.

## What's next?

Once your account is created:

1. **[Log in to the CRE CLI](/cre/account/cli-login)** - Authenticate your CLI session
1. **If you created a new organization (Owner)**: [Invite team members](/cre/organization/inviting-members) to collaborate on workflows
