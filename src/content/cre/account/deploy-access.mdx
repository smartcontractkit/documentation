Deploying workflows to a Chainlink DON requires Early Access approval. You can request access in two ways:

- **From the CLI** — Run `cre account access` to check your status or submit a request directly from your terminal
- **From the web** — Visit <a href="https://cre.chain.link/request-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cre.chain.link/request-access</a> to fill out the request form

## Check your access status

Run the following command to see your current deployment access status:

```bash
cre account access
```

Your access status is also shown when you run `cre whoami`:

```bash
cre whoami
```

```
Account details retrieved:

Email:           email@domain.com
Organization ID: org_mEMRknbVURM9DWsB
Deploy Access:   Not enabled (run 'cre account access' to request)
```

## Request deploy access

If your organization does not have deploy access, `cre account access` will prompt you to submit a request:

```
! Deployment access is not yet enabled for your organization.

  Request deployment access? Yes
```

After confirming, you'll be asked to briefly describe what you're building:

```
  Briefly describe your use case
  What are you building with CRE?
```

Once submitted, you'll see:

```
✓ Access request submitted successfully!

Our team will review your request and get back to you via email shortly.
```

You'll receive a confirmation email, and the Chainlink team will follow up once your request has been reviewed.

<Aside type="note" title="You can keep building while you wait">
  Deploy access is only required for `cre workflow deploy`. You can continue developing and simulating workflows locally with `cre workflow simulate` while your request is under review.
</Aside>

## What happens after approval

Once your organization is granted deploy access, `cre whoami` will show:

```
Deploy Access:   Enabled
```

You can then use `cre workflow deploy` to deploy workflows to the Workflow Registry. See [Deploying Workflows](/cre/guides/operations/deploying-workflows) for next steps.

## Prompted automatically

You don't need to run `cre account access` proactively. The CLI will prompt you to request access automatically in two situations:

- When you run `cre workflow deploy` without access
- After a successful `cre workflow simulate`, as a reminder that deployment is available once access is granted
