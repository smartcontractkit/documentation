Your CRE account is required to use the CRE CLI. You must be authenticated to run CLI commands, including simulating workflows, deploying workflows, and managing deployed workflows. You can authenticate using the browser-based `cre login` flow or an [API key](/cre/reference/cli/authentication#api-key-authentication) for CI/CD and headless environments(\*). This section covers everything you need to know about creating and managing your account.

(\*) API key authentication requires your account to have <a href="https://cre.chain.link/request-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Access</a> approval.

## What you'll need

To use CRE, you need:

1. **A CRE account** - Created through the web interface at <a href="https://cre.chain.link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cre.chain.link</a> (to create a new organization) or via an invitation link from an organization Owner (to join an existing organization)
1. **Two-factor authentication** - Set up during account creation for security
1. **CLI authentication** - Connect your CLI to your account using `cre login` or an [API key](/cre/reference/cli/authentication#api-key-authentication)

## Security features

Your CRE account includes several security features:

- **Recovery codes** - Provided during account setup to regain access if you lose your authenticator device
- **Session management** - CLI sessions automatically expire after a period of inactivity

<Aside type="tip" title="Keep your credentials secure">
  Never share your password, two-factor authentication codes, or recovery codes with anyone. Store your recovery code in
  a secure location separate from your password.
