To deploy and manage workflows with the CRE CLI, you need to authenticate your CLI session with your CRE account. This guide walks you through the browser-based login process.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="tip" title="CI/CD or headless environment?">
  If you need to authenticate without a browser (e.g., in a CI/CD pipeline), use [API key authentication](/cre/reference/cli/authentication#api-key-authentication) instead.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

- [CRE CLI installed](/cre/getting-started/cli-installation) on your machine
- [CRE account created](/cre/account/creating-account)
- Access to your authenticator app for two-factor authentication

## Login process

### Step 1: Initiate login from the terminal

Open your terminal and run the login command:

```bash
cre login
```

This command will automatically open your default web browser to begin the authentication process.

<Aside type="tip" title="Browser doesn't open?">
  If your browser doesn't open automatically, the CLI will display a URL that you can manually copy and paste into your
  browser.
</Aside>

### Step 2: Enter your email address

In the browser window that opens, enter the email address associated with your CRE account and click **"Continue"**.

### Step 3: Enter your password

Enter your account password and click **"Continue"**.

### Step 4: Complete two-factor authentication

You'll be prompted to complete two-factor authentication based on the method you configured during account creation:

- **If you set up an authenticator app**: Open your authenticator app and enter the 6-digit one-time code it generates for your CRE account.
- **If you set up biometric authentication**: Use your fingerprint or face recognition as prompted by your device.

Example of entering a one-time code from an authenticator app:

<ClickToZoom
  src="/images/cre/UI/login/3-one-time-code.webp"
  alt="Enter one-time code (authenticator app example)"
  style="max-width: 350px;"
/>

### Step 5: Confirm successful login

Once authenticated, you'll see a confirmation message in your browser:

<ClickToZoom src="/images/cre/UI/login/4-confirmation.webp" alt="Login confirmation" style="max-width: 500px;" />

You can now close the browser window and return to your terminal. Your terminal will display:

```bash
Login completed successfully
```

Your CLI session is authenticated and ready to use.
