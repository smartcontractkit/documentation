This guide covers how to manage your CLI authentication session, including logging in, checking your status, handling session expiration, and logging out.

## Logging in

To authenticate your CLI with your CRE account, use the `cre login` command. This opens a browser window where you'll enter your credentials and complete two-factor authentication.

For detailed login instructions, see the [Logging in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) guide.

## Session expiration

Your CLI session remains authenticated until you explicitly log out or until your session expires. When your session expires, you'll need to log in again.

If you attempt to run a command with an expired session, you'll see an error:

```bash
Error: failed to attach credentials: failed to load credentials: you are not logged in, try running cre login
```

To resolve this, simply run `cre login` again to re-authenticate.

## Checking authentication status

To verify that you're logged in and view your account details, use the `cre whoami` command:

```bash
cre whoami
```

This command displays your account information:

```bash
Account details retrieved:

Email:           email@domain.com
Organization ID: org_mEMRknbVURM9DWsB
```

If you're not logged in, you'll receive an error message prompting you to run `cre login`.

## Logging out

To explicitly end your CLI session and remove your stored credentials, use the `cre logout` command:

```bash
cre logout
```

After logging out, you'll need to run `cre login` again to authenticate future CLI commands.
