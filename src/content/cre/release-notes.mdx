This page provides detailed release notes for CRE. It includes information on new features, significant changes, and known limitations.

## TS SDK v1.0.3 - January 19, 2026

- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed issue where workflows could execute twice during simulation

- **Examples Updated**: All workflow examples in the SDK repository now use **direct imports** (e.g., `import { HTTPClient } from "@chainlink/cre-sdk"`) instead of the namespace pattern (e.g., `cre.capabilities.HTTPClient`). Both patterns remain fully supported—choose whichever fits your coding style. See [Import styles](/cre/reference/sdk/core-ts#import-styles) for details.

## TS SDK v1.0.2 - January 16, 2026

**TypeScript SDK version 1.0.2** introduces several improvements to developer experience:

**New features:**

- **Optional `main()` call**: You no longer need to call `main()` at the end of your workflow files. The SDK now automatically executes the `main()` function during compilation. See [`main()` reference](/cre/reference/sdk/core-ts#main) for details.
- **Automatic error handling**: If you don't provide custom error handling, the SDK automatically adds `.catch(sendErrorResponse)` to your workflow's `main()` function. This ensures errors are properly reported instead of silently failing.
- **Direct imports**: You can now import SDK components directly (e.g., `import { HTTPClient } from "@chainlink/cre-sdk"`) instead of accessing them through the `cre` namespace (e.g., `cre.capabilities.HTTPClient`). Both import styles remain supported for backward compatibility. See [Import styles](/cre/reference/sdk/core-ts#import-styles) for details and guidance on when to use each pattern.

**Migration notes:**

- **Custom error handling**: If you need custom error handling, you can still add your own `.catch()` handler: `main().catch(myCustomHandler)`. The SDK will respect your custom handler and not override it. See [`main()` reference](/cre/reference/sdk/core-ts#main) for examples.

## Release - November 4, 2025

**Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is now live.** CRE is the all-in-one orchestration layer unlocking institutional-grade smart contracts—data-connected, compliance-ready, privacy-preserving, and interoperable across blockchains and existing systems.

### Available now

- **Build and simulate workflows**: Create an account at [cre.chain.link](https://cre.chain.link), install the CRE CLI, and start building workflows using the Go or TypeScript SDKs. Simulate your workflows locally to test and debug before deployment—simulation makes real calls to live APIs and public EVM blockchains.

### Early Access

- **Deploy and run workflows**: Deploy your workflows to a Chainlink DON with full lifecycle management (deploy, activate, pause, update, delete). Monitor and debug with detailed logs, events, and performance metrics in the CRE UI.
