This page provides detailed release notes for CRE. It includes information on new features, significant changes, and known limitations.

## Release - November 4, 2025

**Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is now live.** CRE is the all-in-one orchestration layer unlocking institutional-grade smart contracts—data-connected, compliance-ready, privacy-preserving, and interoperable across blockchains and existing systems.

### Available now

- **Build and simulate workflows**: Create an account at [cre.chain.link](https://cre.chain.link), install the CRE CLI, and start building workflows using the Go or TypeScript SDKs. Simulate your workflows locally to test and debug before deployment—simulation makes real calls to live APIs and public EVM blockchains.

### Early Access

- **Deploy and run workflows**: Deploy your workflows to a Chainlink DON with full lifecycle management (deploy, activate, pause, update, delete). Monitor and debug with detailed logs, events, and performance metrics in the CRE UI.
