This section provides a reference for the built-in trigger capabilities of the CRE TypeScript SDK. Each trigger type has its own configuration, payload structure, and required callback signature.

- **[Cron Trigger](/cre/reference/sdk/triggers/cron-trigger)**: Fires at a specified schedule using standard cron expressions.
- **[HTTP Trigger](/cre/reference/sdk/triggers/http-trigger)**: Fires when an HTTP request is made to the workflow's designated endpoint.
- **[EVM Log Trigger](/cre/reference/sdk/triggers/evm-log-trigger)**: Fires when a specific log (event) is emitted by an onchain smart contract.
