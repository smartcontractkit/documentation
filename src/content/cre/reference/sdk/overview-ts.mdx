This section provides a detailed technical reference for the public interfaces of the CRE TypeScript SDK. Use this reference for quick lookups of specific functions, types, and method signatures.

## How to read this section

The SDK Reference is broken down into several pages, each corresponding to a core part of the SDK's functionality:

- **[Core SDK](/cre/reference/sdk/core-ts)**: Covers the fundamental building blocks of any workflow, including `handler`, `Runtime`, and the `.result()` pattern for promise resolution.
- **[Triggers](/cre/reference/sdk/triggers/overview-ts)**: Details the configuration and payload structures for all available trigger types (`Cron`, `HTTP`, `EVM Log`).
- **[EVM Client](/cre/reference/sdk/evm-client-ts)**: Provides a reference for the `EVMClient`, the primary tool for all EVM interactions, including reads and writes.
- **[HTTP Client](/cre/reference/sdk/http-client-ts)**: Provides a reference for the `HTTPClient`, used for making offchain API requests from individual nodes.
- **[Confidential HTTP Client](/cre/reference/sdk/confidential-http-client-ts)** _(Experimental)_: Provides a reference for the `ConfidentialHTTPClient`, used for privacy-preserving API requests with enclave execution and optional response encryption.
- **[Consensus & Aggregation](/cre/reference/sdk/consensus-ts)**: Describes how to use aggregators like `consensusMedianAggregation` and `ConsensusAggregationByFields` with `runtime.runInNodeMode()` to process and consolidate data from multiple nodes.

## Package Structure

The TypeScript SDK is distributed as a single npm package `@chainlink/cre-sdk` that exports all necessary functionality:

```typescript
import {
  // Capabilities
  CronCapability,
  HTTPCapability,
  HTTPClient,
  EVMClient,
  // Core functions
  handler, // Register handlers
  Runner, // Workflow runner
  type Runtime, // Runtime interface
  type NodeRuntime, // Node-level runtime interface
  // Consensus
  consensusMedianAggregation,
  consensusIdenticalAggregation,
  // Utilities
  getNetwork, // Chain selector utilities
  bytesToHex, // Data conversion utilities
  hexToBase64,
  // ... and more
} from "@chainlink/cre-sdk"
```

<Aside type="note" title="Import styles">
  The SDK supports two import styles: **direct imports** (shown above) and **namespace imports** (e.g.,
  `cre.capabilities.HTTPClient`). Both are fully supported and produce identical behavior. See the [Core SDK
  Reference](/cre/reference/sdk/core-ts#import-styles) for details on both patterns.

## Understanding TypeScript Types

The TypeScript SDK uses Protocol Buffers for type definitions, which generates two type representations for each message:

- **`Type`** (e.g., `CallMsg`): Runtime types using `Uint8Array`, protobuf `BigInt`, and protobuf `Message` objects. These are efficient for in-memory processing.
- **`TypeJson`** (e.g., `CallMsgJson`): JSON-serializable types using `string`, `number`, and plain objects. These are used for serialization and I/O operations.

**As a developer, you always use JSON types.** The SDK automatically converts between representations when crossing WASM boundaries.

```typescript
// You write (JSON types - convenient):
evmClient.callContract(runtime, {
  call: {
    from: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb", // string (hex)
    to: "0x123...",
    data: "0xabc...",
  },
  blockNumber: "12345", // string representation
})

// SDK handles internally (native types - efficient):
// - Converts strings to Uint8Array
// - Processes with protobuf types
// - Converts results back to JSON types for your callback
```

In this reference documentation, type tables show **JSON types only**, as these are what you'll use when writing workflows.

## Working with Contract ABIs

The TypeScript SDK integrates with <a href="https://viem.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">viem</a> for type-safe contract interactions. You define ABIs directly in TypeScript files and use viem's functions for encoding and decoding. For detailed examples and best practices, see the [Onchain Read guide](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-read).

## Runtime Environment

TypeScript workflows are compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) using Javy and QuickJS. This compilation process has implications for library compatibility and available Node.js APIs. See [TypeScript Runtime Environment](/cre/concepts/typescript-wasm-runtime) for details on the compilation pipeline, QuickJS compatibility, and how to verify library compatibility.

## Runtime Requirements

- **Bun**: >= 1.2.21
- **TypeScript**: >= 5.9
- **Dependencies**: `viem` (`^2.34.0`), `zod` (`^3.25.76`)
