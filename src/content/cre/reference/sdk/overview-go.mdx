<Aside type="note" title="Required SDK Version: v1.0.0">
    To ensure compatibility, please use version `v1.0.0` for the core `cre-sdk-go` package and `v1.0.0-beta.0` for capability packages.

    Always use `go get` with an explicit version tag to add dependencies:<br/>
    - Core SDK: `go get github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-sdk-go@v1.0.0`<br/>
    - Capabilities: `go get github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-sdk-go/capabilities/networking/http@v1.0.0-beta.0`

This section provides a detailed technical reference for the public interfaces of the CRE Go SDK. Use this reference for quick lookups of specific functions, types, and method signatures.

## How to read this section

The SDK Reference is broken down into several pages, each corresponding to a core part of the SDK's functionality:

- **[Core SDK](/cre/reference/sdk/core)**: Covers the fundamental building blocks of any workflow, including `cre.Handler`, `cre.Runtime`, and `cre.Promise`.
- **[Triggers](/cre/reference/sdk/triggers)**: Details the configuration and payload structures for all available trigger types (`Cron`, `HTTP`, `EVM Log`).
- **[EVM Client](/cre/reference/sdk/evm-client)**: Provides a reference for the `evm.Client`, the primary tool for all EVM interactions, including reads and writes.
- **[HTTP Client](/cre/reference/sdk/http-client)**: Provides a reference for the `http.Client`, used for making offchain API requests from individual nodes.
- **[Consensus & Aggregation](/cre/reference/sdk/consensus)**: Describes how to use aggregators like `ConsensusMedianAggregation` and `ConsensusAggregationFromTags` with `RunInNodeMode` to process and consolidate data from multiple nodes.

## Contract Bindings

For interacting with smart contracts, use the [CRE CLI's binding generator](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/generating-bindings) to automatically create type-safe Go bindings from your contract ABIs. These generated bindings work seamlessly with the EVM Client to provide a simple and reliable developer experience.
