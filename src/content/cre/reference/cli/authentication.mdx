The CRE CLI supports two authentication methods:

- **Browser-based login** (`cre login`) — Interactive login for local development
- **API key** (`CRE_API_KEY` environment variable) — Non-interactive authentication for CI/CD pipelines and headless environments

## Browser-based authentication

### `cre login`

Starts the interactive authentication flow. This command opens your browser for user login and saves your credentials locally.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre login
```

**Authentication steps:**

1. The CLI opens your default web browser to the login page
1. Enter your account email address
1. Enter your account password
1. Enter your one-time password (OTP) from your authenticator app
1. The CLI automatically captures and saves your credentials locally

For a detailed walkthrough with screenshots, see [Logging in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login).

### `cre logout`

Revokes authentication tokens and removes local credentials. This invalidates the current authentication tokens and deletes stored credentials from your machine.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre logout
```

### `cre whoami`

Shows your current account details. This command fetches and displays your account information, including your email and organization ID. This works with both browser-based login and API key authentication.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre whoami
```

<Aside type="note" title="Verify authentication">
  Use `cre whoami` to verify you're authenticated and check which account is currently active. This is useful before deploying workflows or performing other authenticated operations.

## API key authentication

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Deploy access required">
  API key authentication requires your account to have Early Access approval for deployment. To <a href="https://cre.chain.link/request-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request Early Access</a>, please share details about your project and use case—this helps us provide better support as you build with CRE.
</Aside>

For CI/CD pipelines, automated scripts, or any environment where a browser is not available, you can authenticate using an API key. When the `CRE_API_KEY` environment variable is set, the CLI uses it automatically — no `cre login` required.

### Creating an API key

1. Log in to the <a href="https://cre.chain.link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRE platform</a>
1. Navigate to the **Organization** page
1. Select the **APIs** tab
1. Click **+ Organization API**
1. Give your key a name and confirm

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="caution" title="Keep your API key secure">
  Treat your API key like a password. Do not commit it to version control or share it in plain text. Use your CI/CD platform's secret management to store it securely.
</Aside>

### Using the API key

Set the `CRE_API_KEY` environment variable before running CLI commands:

```bash
export CRE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
cre whoami
```

When `CRE_API_KEY` is set, the CLI skips the browser-based login flow entirely. All commands that require authentication (deploying, managing workflows, etc.) will use the API key.

In a CI/CD pipeline, configure `CRE_API_KEY` as a secret environment variable in your platform and run CLI commands as usual.

| `cre login`                             | Local development                     | Opens a browser for interactive login with 2FA       |
| `CRE_API_KEY`                           | CI/CD, scripts, headless environments | Set the environment variable — no browser needed(\*) |

(\*) API key authentication requires your account to have <a href="https://cre.chain.link/request-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Access</a> approval.
