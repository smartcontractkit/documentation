The authentication commands manage your CRE credentials and account information.

<Aside type="note" title="Global flags">
  All `cre` commands support [global flags](/cre/reference/cli#global-flags) like `--env`, `--target`, `--project-root`,
  and `--verbose`.
</Aside>

## `cre login`

Starts the authentication flow. This command opens your browser for user login and saves your credentials locally.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre login
```

**Authentication steps:**

1. The CLI opens your default web browser to the login page
1. Enter your account email address
1. Enter your account password
1. Enter your one-time password (OTP) from your authenticator app
1. The CLI automatically captures and saves your credentials locally

## `cre logout`

Revokes authentication tokens and removes local credentials. This invalidates the current authentication tokens and deletes stored credentials from your machine.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre logout
```

## `cre whoami`

Shows your current account details. This command fetches and displays your account information, including your email and organization ID.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre whoami
```

<Aside type="note" title="Verify authentication">
  Use `cre whoami` to verify you're logged in and check which account is currently active. This is useful before
  deploying workflows or performing other authenticated operations.
</Aside>

## Authentication workflow

The typical authentication flow:

1. **`cre login`** — Authenticate with the CRE UI (browser-based)
1. **`cre whoami`** — Verify your authentication and account details
1. **Perform CLI operations** — Deploy, manage workflows, etc.
1. **`cre logout`** — (Optional) Revoke credentials when done
