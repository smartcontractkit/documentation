## `cre update`

Updates the CRE CLI to the latest version. This command automatically downloads and installs the newest release, making it easy to stay up to date.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre update
```

**Behavior:**

- Checks for the latest available version on <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
- Compares it with your currently installed version
- Automatically downloads and installs the update if a newer version is available
- Downloads the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture
- Replaces the existing CLI binary with the new version

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="tip" title="Automatic version checks">
  The CLI automatically checks if your version is outdated when you run certain commands. If a newer version is available, you'll see a warning message encouraging you to run `cre update`.
</Aside>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Updating existing projects">
  Running `cre update` updates the CLI itself. For existing projects, you may also need to update your SDK dependency to access new features. See [Updating Dependencies](/cre/reference/project-configuration#updating-dependencies) for instructions.
</Aside>

## `cre version`

Prints the current version of the CRE CLI.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre version
```

**Example output:**

```bash
cre version v1.0.11
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Version compatibility">
  Always check that your CLI version matches the version recommended in the documentation. The current recommended version is **v1.0.11**. See the [CLI Installation guide](/cre/getting-started/cli-installation) for more information.
