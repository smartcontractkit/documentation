The `cre workflow` commands manage workflows throughout their entire lifecycle, from local testing to deployment and ongoing management.

## `cre workflow simulate`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Compiles your workflow to WASM and executes it in a local simulation environment. This is the core command for testing and debugging your workflow.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre workflow simulate <workflow-name-or-path> [flags]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<workflow-name-or-path>` — (Required) Workflow folder name (e.g., `my-workflow`) or path (e.g., `./my-workflow`). When run from the project root, you can use just the folder name. The CLI looks for a `workflow.yaml` file in the workflow directory.

**Flags:**

| <div style={{ width: "200px" }}>Flag</div> | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--broadcast`                              | Broadcast onchain write transactions (default: `false`). Without this flag, a dry run is performed |
| `-g, --engine-logs`                        | Enable non-fatal engine logging                                                                    |
| `--non-interactive`                        | Run without prompts; requires `--trigger-index` and inputs for the selected trigger type           |
| `--trigger-index <int>`                    | Index of the trigger to run (0-based). Required when using `--non-interactive`                     |
| `--http-payload <string>`                  | HTTP trigger payload as JSON string or path to JSON file (with or without `@` prefix)              |
| `--evm-tx-hash <string>`                   | EVM trigger transaction hash (`0x...`). For EVM log triggers                                       |
| `--evm-event-index <int>`                  | EVM trigger log index (0-based). For EVM log triggers                                              |

**Examples:**

- Basic simulation

  ```bash
  cre workflow simulate ./my-workflow --target local-simulation
  ```

- Broadcast real onchain transactions

  ```bash
  cre workflow simulate ./my-workflow --broadcast --target local-simulation
  ```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Dry run by default">
  By default, `cre workflow simulate` performs a **dry run** for onchain write operations. It simulates the transaction to confirm it would succeed, but does not broadcast it to the network. This results in a successful log with an empty transaction hash (`0x`). To send a real transaction, use the `--broadcast` flag.
</Aside>

## `cre workflow deploy`

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Deployment access required">
  Deploying workflows requires Early Access approval. If you don't have deployment access yet, <a href="https://cre.chain.link/request-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request it here</a>.
  
  **While you wait:** Continue building and simulating workflows using [`cre workflow simulate`](/cre/guides/operations/simulating-workflows).
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Deploys a workflow to the Workflow Registry contract. This command compiles your workflow, uploads the artifacts to the CRE Storage Service, and registers the workflow onchain.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre workflow deploy <workflow-name-or-path> [flags]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<workflow-name-or-path>` — (Required) Workflow folder name (e.g., `my-workflow`) or path (e.g., `./my-workflow`)

**Flags:**

| <div style={{ width: "150px" }}>Flag</div> | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-r, --auto-start`                         | Activate the workflow immediately after deployment (default: `true`)                           |
| `-o, --output`                             | Output file for the compiled WASM binary encoded in base64 (default: `"./binary.wasm.br.b64"`) |
| `--unsigned`                               | Return the raw transaction instead of sending it to the network                                |
| `--yes`                                    | Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed with the operation                                    |

**Examples:**

- Deploy workflow with auto-start (default behavior)

  ```bash
  cre workflow deploy my-workflow --target production-settings
  ```

- Deploy without auto-starting

  ```bash
  cre workflow deploy my-workflow --auto-start=false --target production-settings
  ```

- Deploy and save the compiled binary to a custom location

  ```bash
  cre workflow deploy my-workflow --output ./dist/workflow.wasm.br.b64
  ```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Auto-start behavior">
  By default, workflows are automatically activated after deployment (`--auto-start=true`). This means they're ready to respond to triggers immediately. Use `--auto-start=false` if you need to deploy without activating.
</Aside>

For more details, see [Deploying Workflows](/cre/guides/operations/deploying-workflows).

## `cre workflow activate`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Changes the workflow status to active on the Workflow Registry contract. Active workflows can respond to their configured triggers.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre workflow activate <workflow-name-or-path> [flags]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<workflow-name-or-path>` — (Required) Workflow folder name (e.g., `my-workflow`) or path (e.g., `./my-workflow`)

**Flags:**

| Flag         | Description                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--unsigned` | Return the raw transaction instead of sending it to the network |
| `--yes`      | Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed with the operation     |

**Example:**

```bash
cre workflow activate ./my-workflow --target production-settings
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="When to use activate">
  You typically use `activate` after deploying with `--auto-start=false` or after pausing a workflow. Most workflows are automatically activated during deployment.
</Aside>

For more details, see [Activating & Pausing Workflows](/cre/guides/operations/activating-pausing-workflows).

## `cre workflow pause`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Changes the workflow status to paused on the Workflow Registry contract. Paused workflows will not respond to triggers.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre workflow pause <workflow-name-or-path> [flags]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<workflow-name-or-path>` — (Required) Workflow folder name (e.g., `my-workflow`) or path (e.g., `./my-workflow`)

**Flags:**

| Flag         | Description                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--unsigned` | Return the raw transaction instead of sending it to the network |
| `--yes`      | Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed with the operation     |

**Example:**

```bash
cre workflow pause ./my-workflow --target production-settings
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="caution" title="Pausing stops trigger execution">
  When you pause a workflow, it will no longer respond to any triggers. Ensure this is intentional before pausing production workflows.
</Aside>

For more details, see [Activating & Pausing Workflows](/cre/guides/operations/activating-pausing-workflows).

## `cre workflow delete`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Deletes a workflow from the Workflow Registry.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre workflow delete <workflow-name-or-path> [flags]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<workflow-name-or-path>` — (Required) Workflow folder name (e.g., `my-workflow`) or path (e.g., `./my-workflow`)

**Flags:**

| Flag         | Description                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--unsigned` | Return the raw transaction instead of sending it to the network |
| `--yes`      | Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed with the operation     |

**Example:**

```bash
cre workflow delete ./my-workflow --target production-settings
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="caution" title="Destructive operation">
  This command **permanently deletes the workflow**. The `--yes` flag bypasses the confirmation prompt for this destructive operation. Use with caution.
</Aside>

For more details, see [Deleting Workflows](/cre/guides/operations/deleting-workflows).

## Workflow lifecycle

The typical workflow lifecycle uses these commands in sequence:

1. **Develop locally** — Write and iterate on your workflow code
1. **`cre workflow simulate`** — Test your workflow in a local simulation environment
1. **`cre workflow deploy`** — Deploy your workflow to the registry (auto-starts by default)
1. **`cre workflow pause`** / **`cre workflow activate`** — Control workflow execution as needed
1. **`cre workflow deploy`** (again) — Deploy updates (replaces the existing workflow)
1. **`cre workflow delete`** — Remove the workflow when no longer needed
