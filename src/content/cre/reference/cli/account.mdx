The `cre account` commands manage your linked public key addresses for workflow operations. These commands allow you to link wallet addresses to your CRE account, list linked addresses, and unlink them when needed.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Global flags">
  All `cre` commands support [global flags](/cre/reference/cli#global-flags) like `--env`, `--target`, `--project-root`, and `--verbose`.
</Aside>

## `cre account access`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Checks your organization's deployment access status and lets you submit a request for Early Access directly from the CLI.

For a full walkthrough including the interactive flow and web UI option, see [Requesting Deploy Access](/cre/account/deploy-access).

**Usage:**

```bash
cre account access
```

**Interactive flow:**

When you run this command, the CLI will:

1. Check whether your organization has deployment access enabled
1. If not, prompt you to submit a request
1. Ask you to briefly describe your use case
1. Confirm the request was submitted — the Chainlink team will follow up via email

**Example output (access not yet enabled):**

```
! Deployment access is not yet enabled for your organization.

  Request deployment access? Yes

  Briefly describe your use case
  What are you building with CRE?
  > I'm working on a prediction market and I need to deploy my workflow! (or whatever you're building)

✓ Access request submitted successfully!

Our team will review your request and get back to you via email shortly.
```

## `cre account link-key`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Links a public key address to your account for workflow operations. This command reads your private key from the `.env` file (for EOA) or uses your configuration (for multi-sig), derives the public address, and registers it onchain in the Workflow Registry contract.

For a complete step-by-step guide with examples, see [Linking Wallet Keys](/cre/organization/linking-keys).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites for link-key">
  - **Must run from a project directory** with a `project.yaml` file
  - **`.env` must contain `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`** — Your wallet's private key
  - **Wallet must be funded** with ETH on Ethereum Mainnet to pay gas fees
  - **RPC endpoint configured** — Add an `ethereum-mainnet` RPC URL in your `project.yaml` under the `rpcs` section for your target (e.g., `https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com` or your preferred provider)
  - **For multi-sig wallets**: Also specify `workflow-owner-address` in your `project.yaml` under the `account` section. See [Linking Wallet Keys](/cre/organization/linking-keys#using-multi-sig-wallets) for details.
</Aside>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Transaction is sent to Ethereum Mainnet">
  This command always submits a transaction to **Ethereum Mainnet**, regardless of your workflow deployment environment. Ensure your wallet has sufficient ETH for gas fees and your `project.yaml` includes an RPC configuration for `ethereum-mainnet`:

```yaml
rpcs:
  - chain-name: ethereum-mainnet
    url: https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com # Or your preferred RPC provider
```

</Aside>

**Usage:**

```bash
cre account link-key [flags]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag                | Description                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-l, --owner-label` | Label for the workflow owner                                    |
| `--unsigned`        | Return the raw transaction instead of sending it to the network |
| `--yes`             | Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed with the operation     |

**Interactive flow:**

When you run this command, the CLI will:

1. Extract your public address from the private key in your `.env` file
1. Prompt you to provide a label for this address (e.g., "Production Wallet")
1. Check if the address is already linked
1. Display transaction details (chain, contract, estimated gas cost)
1. Ask for confirmation to execute the transaction
1. Submit the transaction and provide a block explorer link

**Examples:**

- Interactive mode (recommended)

  ```bash
  cre account link-key
  ```

- Non-interactive mode with label

  ```bash
  cre account link-key --owner-label "My Production Wallet" --yes
  ```

## `cre account list-key`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Lists all public key addresses linked to your organization. This shows the verification status, chain information, and contract addresses for each linked key.

For a complete guide on linking and managing keys, see [Linking Wallet Keys](/cre/organization/linking-keys).

**Usage:**

```bash
cre account list-key
```

**Example output:**

```bash
Workflow owners retrieved successfully:

Linked Owners:

  1. my-production-wallet
     Owner Address:     <your_public_address>
     Status:            VERIFICATION_STATUS_SUCCESSFULL
     Verified At:       <timestamp>
     Chain Selector:    <chain_selector>
     Contract Address:  <Workflow_Registry_address>
```

## `cre account unlink-key`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.
</Aside>

Unlinks a previously linked public key address from your account. This is a destructive operation that removes the address from the Workflow Registry contract and deletes all workflows registered under that address.

For a complete guide on linking and unlinking keys, see [Linking Wallet Keys](/cre/organization/linking-keys).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="caution" title="Destructive operation">
  **Unlinking will delete all workflows registered under this address.** This action cannot be undone. Make sure you want to permanently remove all workflows associated with this address before proceeding.
</Aside>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Aside type="note" title="Prerequisites for unlink-key">
  - Must run from a project directory with a `project.yaml` file
  - **`.env` must contain `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`** — The private key of the address you want to unlink
  - Wallet must be funded with ETH on Ethereum Mainnet to pay gas fees
</Aside>

**Usage:**

```bash
cre account unlink-key [flags]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag         | Description                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--unsigned` | Return the raw transaction instead of sending it to the network |
| `--yes`      | Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed with the operation     |

**Interactive flow:**

When you run this command, the CLI will:

1. Extract your public address from the private key in your `.env` file (for EOA) or use your configuration (for multi-sig)
1. **Display a destructive action warning** about deleting all workflows
1. Ask for first confirmation to proceed with unlinking
1. Display transaction details (chain, contract, estimated gas cost)
1. Ask for second confirmation to execute the transaction
1. Submit the transaction and provide a block explorer link
