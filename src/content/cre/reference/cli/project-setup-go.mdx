The project setup commands include `cre init` to initialize new CRE projects or add workflows, and `cre generate-bindings` to generate contract bindings for type-safe contract interactions.

<Aside type="note" title="Global flags">
  All `cre` commands support [global flags](/cre/reference/cli#global-flags) like `--env`, `--target`, `--project-root`,
  and `--verbose`.
</Aside>

## `cre init`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.

Initializes a new CRE project or adds a workflow to an existing project. The behavior depends on your current directory:

- **In a directory without a project**: Creates a new project with the first workflow
- **In an existing project directory**: Adds a new workflow to the existing project

**Usage:**

```bash
cre init [flags]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag                  | Description                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `-p, --project-name`  | Name for the new project           |
| `-t, --template-id`   | ID of the workflow template to use |
| `-w, --workflow-name` | Name for the new workflow          |

**Interactive mode (recommended):**

Running `cre init` without flags starts an interactive setup that guides you through the process:

1. **Project name** (only if creating a new project)
1. **Language** (Go or TypeScript)
1. **Workflow template** (fetched dynamically from configured template sources)
1. **Workflow name**

<Aside type="note" title="Template sources">
  Templates are fetched at runtime from GitHub. The Chainlink official repository is included by default. To browse available templates or add custom sources, see [Template Sources](/cre/reference/cli/templates).
</Aside>

**Example:**

```bash
# Interactive setup
cre init
```

**Non-interactive mode:**

```bash
# Create a new project with initial workflow
cre init \
  --project-name my-cre-project \
  --workflow-name my-workflow \
  --template-id 1
```

<Aside type="note" title="Interactive vs. non-interactive">
  For most users, running `cre init` without flags (interactive mode) is the easiest way to set up a project. The CLI
  will guide you through the setup process with clear prompts.
</Aside>

## `cre generate-bindings`

<Aside type="note" title="Authentication required">
  Running this command requires you to be logged in with the CRE CLI. Run `cre whoami` in your terminal to verify you're
  logged in, or run `cre login` to authenticate. See [Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account) and [Logging
  in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login) for further details.

Generates Go bindings from contract ABI files. This enables type-safe contract interactions in your Go workflows.

**Usage:**

```bash
cre generate-bindings <chain-family> [flags]
```

**Arguments:**

- `<chain-family>` — (Required) Chain family. Currently supports: `evm`

**Flags:**

| <div style={{ width: "180px" }}>Flag</div> | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a, --abi`                                | Path to ABI directory (default: `"contracts/{chain-family}/src/abi/"`)             |
| `-l, --language`                           | Target language (default: `"go"`)                                                  |
| `-k, --pkg`                                | Base package name; each contract gets its own subdirectory (default: `"bindings"`) |
| `-p, --project-root`                       | Path to project root directory (default: current directory)                        |

**How it works:**

- Supports EVM chain family and Go language
- Each contract gets its own package subdirectory to avoid naming conflicts
- For example, `IERC20.abi` generates bindings in `generated/ierc20/` package
- Generated bindings are placed in `contracts/{chain-family}/src/generated/`
- For each contract, two files are generated:
  - `<ContractName>.go` — Main binding for contract interaction
  - `<ContractName>_mock.go` — Mock implementation for testing workflows without deployed contracts

**Examples:**

- Generate bindings for all ABI files in the default directory

  ```bash
  cre generate-bindings evm
  ```

- Generate bindings with custom ABI directory

  ```bash
  cre generate-bindings evm --abi ./custom-abis
  ```

- Generate bindings with custom package name

  ```bash
  cre generate-bindings evm --pkg mycontracts
  ```

<Aside type="note" title="When to run this command">
  Run `cre generate-bindings` whenever you add new contract ABI files to your project or update existing ones. This ensures your Go code has up-to-date type-safe bindings.

## Project initialization workflow

The typical project setup flow for Go workflows:

1. **`cre init`** — Create a new project or add a workflow (interactive or with flags)
1. **Add contract ABIs** — Place ABI files in `contracts/evm/src/abi/`
1. **`cre generate-bindings evm`** — Generate Go bindings from ABIs
1. **Sync dependencies** — Run `go mod tidy` to update your `go.mod`
1. **Start development** — Write your workflow code
