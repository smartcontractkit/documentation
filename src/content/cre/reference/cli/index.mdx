<Aside type="note" title="Required CLI Version: v1.1.0">
  To ensure compatibility with the guides and examples in this documentation, please use version `v1.1.0` of the CRE
  CLI. You can check your installed version by running `cre version`. Refer to the [CLI
  Installation](/cre/getting-started/cli-installation/macos-linux) guide for more information.
</Aside>

The CRE Command Line Interface (CLI) is your primary tool for developing, testing, deploying, and managing workflows. It handles project setup, contract binding generation (Go workflows only), local simulation, and workflow lifecycle management.

## Global flags

These flags can be used with any `cre` command.

| `-h, --help`                          | Displays help information for any command                                                                                                                                                  |
| `-e, --env`                           | Specifies the path to your `.env` file (default: `".env"`)                                                                                                                                 |
