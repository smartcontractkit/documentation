This page provides a concise mapping of Gelato Web3 Functions concepts to their CRE equivalents.

[CRE](/cre) runs your code across a [Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)](/cre/key-terms#decentralized-oracle-network-don) — a group of independent nodes that each execute your workflow and reach [consensus](/cre/concepts/consensus-computing) on the result.

Unlike a single-executor model, every operation — API calls, blockchain reads, onchain writes — is cryptographically verified by multiple nodes, giving your workflows institutional-grade security and reliability with no single point of failure.

If any term below is unfamiliar, see the [Key Terms](/cre/key-terms) glossary.

## Terminology

The core concepts map closely between platforms, but the names differ:

| Gelato                         | CRE                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web3 Function**              | **Workflow**                    | Your compiled application. In CRE, workflows are WASM binaries deployed to a [DON](/cre/key-terms#decentralized-oracle-network-don).                    |
| **`onRun` function**           | **Callback**                    | The function containing your business logic, invoked when a trigger fires.                                                                              |
| **Task**                       | **Handler**                     | The binding of a trigger to a callback: `cre.Handler(trigger, callback)`.                                                                               |
| **Trigger (time/event/block)** | **Trigger (cron/EVM log/HTTP)** | The event that starts execution. CRE adds HTTP triggers.                                                                                                |
| **Gelato Executor**            | **Workflow DON**                | The infrastructure that runs your code. CRE uses a Decentralized Oracle Network instead of a single executor.                                           |
| **Gelato Relay**               | **Capability DON**              | The service that performs specific operations (chain writes, HTTP fetches). Each [capability](/cre/capabilities) runs on its own DON with consensus.    |
| **`userArgs` / `schema.json`** | **Config / `config.json`**      | Runtime parameters. CRE uses typed Go structs for configuration schemas.                                                                                |
| **`context.secrets`**          | **`runtime.GetSecret()`**       | Secret access at runtime. CRE uses a `secrets.yaml` manifest + [Vault DON](/cre/guides/workflow/secrets/using-secrets-deployed) for deployed workflows. |

## Configuration

**Gelato** uses a combination of the Gelato UI, SDK, and IPFS for task creation and deployment. Configuration is split between `schema.json` (for `userArgs`), the UI (for triggers and secrets), and your function code.

**CRE** consolidates everything into files within your code repository:

| File                   | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.go`              | Your workflow code (triggers, callbacks, business logic)                                |
| `config.<target>.json` | Runtime parameters per target (e.g., `config.staging.json`). Replaces Gelato `userArgs` |
| `secrets.yaml`         | Declares secret names; values come from `.env` (simulation) or Vault DON (deployed)     |
| `project.yaml`         | Project-level configuration (project name, shared settings)                             |
| `workflow.yaml`        | Per-workflow configuration (workflow name, paths to artifacts and config files)         |

All deployment and management is done through the CRE CLI (`cre workflow simulate`, `cre workflow deploy`, etc.), not a separate UI or IPFS.

## Triggers

### Time-based

**Gelato**: Time intervals (e.g., "every 5 minutes") or cron expressions, configured through the UI or SDK.

**CRE**: Standard cron expressions (5 or 6 fields) configured directly in your code. Supports timezone prefixes (e.g., `TZ=America/New_York 0 9 * * 1-5`). Minimum interval is 30 seconds.

```go
// CRE cron trigger
cronTrigger := cron.Trigger(&cron.Config{Schedule: "0 */5 * * * *"})
cre.Handler(cronTrigger, onCronTrigger)
```

See the [Cron Trigger guide](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/cron-trigger) for full details.

### HTTP triggers

**Gelato**: Not natively supported as a trigger type.

**CRE**: Start a workflow execution in response to an external HTTP request. Supports authentication and passes the request body to your callback.

See the [HTTP Trigger guide](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/http-trigger/overview) for details.

### Onchain events

**Gelato**: Event-based triggers that watch for smart contract events, configured in the UI.

**CRE**: `evm.LogTrigger()` watches for specific contract events. You specify contract addresses and optionally filter by event topics, directly in your workflow code.

See the [EVM Log Trigger guide](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/evm-log-trigger) for details.

### Per-block triggers

**Gelato**: Native "every block" trigger type.

**CRE**: No direct equivalent. Use a short cron interval (e.g., every 30 seconds) or an EVM log trigger to achieve similar behavior.

## Task authoring and output

### Language and runtime

**Gelato**: TypeScript running in a Deno-like Node.js environment. Full access to `fetch()`, npm packages, and ethers.js.

**CRE**: Go compiled to WASM. Your workflow code is compiled to a WebAssembly binary and executed by DON nodes. The Go SDK provides built-in clients for all common operations (HTTP, EVM, secrets).

### HTTP / API calls

**Gelato**: `fetch()` or axios, running on a single executor.

**CRE**: `http.SendRequest()` — each DON node fetches independently, and results are aggregated via [consensus](/cre/concepts/consensus-computing). Your API data is validated across multiple nodes before your workflow uses it.

CRE also offers a [Confidential HTTP](/cre/capabilities/confidential-http) capability for privacy-preserving API calls — secrets are injected inside a secure enclave and responses can be optionally encrypted.

### Onchain reads

**Gelato**: `multiChainProvider.default()` with ethers.js.

**CRE**: `evm.Client` with [generated bindings](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/generating-bindings) for type-safe ABI encoding/decoding and contract interactions. A single workflow can read from and write to [multiple chains](/cre/reference/sdk/evm-client) — no need for separate infrastructure per chain.

See the [Onchain Read guide](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-read) for details.

### Onchain writes

**Gelato**: Return `{ canExec: true, callData: [...] }` from your function. Gelato relays the transaction.

**CRE**: Two-step process with consensus verification:

1. Generate a [signed report](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-write/overview) with `runtime.GenerateReport()`
1. Submit it onchain with `evm.Client.WriteReport()`

```go
// 1. Generate a signed report
report, err := runtime.GenerateReport(&cre.ReportRequest{
    EncodedPayload: encodedValue,
}).Await()

// 2. Submit the report onchain (using generated binding helper)
txResult, err := contract.WriteReportFromMyResult(runtime, report, &evm.GasConfig{
    GasLimit: gasLimit,
}).Await()
```

The **[KeystoneForwarder](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-write/overview)** contract verifies the DON's signatures before calling your [consumer contract](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-write/building-consumer-contracts). This is the biggest architectural difference — CRE writes are cryptographically verified by the decentralized network, not relayed by a single executor.

See the [Onchain Write guide](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-write/overview) and [Building Consumer Contracts](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-write/building-consumer-contracts).

### Secrets

**Gelato**: `context.secrets.get("KEY")`, configured in the UI.

**CRE**: Declare secrets in `secrets.yaml`, provide values via `.env` (simulation) or Vault DON (deployed), access via `runtime.GetSecret()` in your code. The API is the same regardless of environment.

See the [Secrets guide](/cre/guides/workflow/secrets) for details.

## Monitoring

**Gelato**: Task dashboard in the Gelato UI showing execution history, logs, and status.

**CRE**: The [CRE UI](https://cre.chain.link) provides:

- Workflow status and lifecycle management (active, paused, etc.)
- Detailed execution logs and events
- Performance metrics and debugging tools

See the [Monitoring & Debugging guide](/cre/guides/operations/monitoring-workflows) for details.
