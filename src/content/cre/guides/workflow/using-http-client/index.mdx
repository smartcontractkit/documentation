The CRE SDK provides an HTTP client that allows your workflows to interact with external APIs. Use it to fetch offchain data, send results to other systems, or trigger external events.

These guides will walk you through the common use cases for the HTTP client.

## Guides

- **[Making GET Requests](/cre/guides/workflow/using-http-client/get-request)**: Learn how to fetch data from a public API using a `GET` request.
- **[Making POST Requests](/cre/guides/workflow/using-http-client/post-request)**: Learn how to send data to an external endpoint using a `POST` request.
- **[Submitting Reports via HTTP](/cre/guides/workflow/using-http-client/submitting-reports-http)**: Learn how to submit cryptographically signed reports to an external HTTP endpoint.
