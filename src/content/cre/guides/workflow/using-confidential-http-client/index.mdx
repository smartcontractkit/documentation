The CRE SDK provides a Confidential HTTP client that allows your workflows to interact with external APIs while keeping sensitive data private. Requests execute inside a secure enclave, secrets are injected via templates, and responses can optionally be encrypted.

For a conceptual overview of what Confidential HTTP is and how it differs from the regular HTTP capability, see [The Confidential HTTP Capability](/cre/capabilities/confidential-http).
