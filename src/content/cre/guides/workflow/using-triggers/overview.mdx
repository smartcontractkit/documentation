Triggers are a special type of capability that start your workflows. They are event-driven services that watch for a specific condition to be met. When the condition occurs, the trigger fires and instructs CRE to run the callback function you have registered for that event.

A single workflow can contain multiple handlers, allowing you to react to different events with specific logic.

This section provides detailed guides for each available trigger type:

- **[Cron Trigger](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/cron-trigger)**: Run workflows on a time-based schedule.
- **[HTTP Trigger](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/http-trigger)**: Start workflows in response to an HTTP request from an external system.
- **[EVM Log Trigger](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/evm-log-trigger)**: Initiate workflows in response to a specific event being emitted by a smart contract.
