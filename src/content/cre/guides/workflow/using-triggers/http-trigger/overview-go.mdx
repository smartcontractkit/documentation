The HTTP trigger allows external systems to initiate your workflow execution by making HTTP requests to a designated endpoint. This enables on-demand workflow execution, webhook integration, and API-driven automation.

## How HTTP triggers work

When you deploy a workflow with an HTTP trigger:

1. **External systems send HTTP POST requests** to a CRE gateway
1. **The request specifies your workflow ID** in the JSON-RPC body along with the input payload
1. **Requests must be cryptographically signed** using a private key corresponding to an authorized EVM address in the target workflow
1. **CRE validates the signature** against your configured `authorizedKeys`
1. **If authorized**, your workflow callback executes with the request payload

<Aside type="caution" title="Authorization required for deployed workflows">
  For **deployed workflows**, HTTP triggers use cryptographic signatures to ensure only authorized addresses can execute
  your workflow. During **local simulation**, you can use empty authorization configs to simplify testing—just remember
  to add `authorizedKeys` before deploying. Learn more: [Configuration &
  Handler](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/http-trigger/configuration-go#configuration-and-handler).
</Aside>

## When to use HTTP triggers

HTTP triggers are ideal for:

- **Webhook integration**: Receive events from external services (GitHub, payment processors, etc.)
- **On-demand execution**: Allow users or systems to trigger specific workflow logic when needed
- **API gateway patterns**: Create authenticated endpoints that execute blockchain operations
- **Event bridging**: Connect offchain systems events to workflows

## The complete HTTP trigger journey

This section provides everything you need to work with HTTP triggers:

1. **[Configuration & Handler](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/http-trigger/configuration)** - Learn how to configure HTTP triggers in your workflow code and write handler functions to process incoming requests

1. **[Testing in Simulation](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/http-trigger/testing-in-simulation)** - Test your HTTP trigger locally using the `cre workflow simulate` command before deploying

1. **[Triggering Deployed Workflows](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/http-trigger/triggering-deployed-workflows)** - Understand the JSON-RPC format and JWT authentication required to trigger your deployed workflows

1. **[Testing with Local JWT Server](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/http-trigger/local-testing-tool)** - Run a local proxy server that automatically generates JWT tokens and sends authenticated requests to the CRE gateway for testing your deployed workflows

## Quick comparison: Simulation vs Production

| Aspect             | Simulation                      | Production                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authorization**  | Optional (can use empty config) | Required (`authorizedKeys` must be configured)           |
| **Trigger method** | CLI with `--input` flag         | HTTP POST to gateway endpoint with JWT                   |
| **Endpoint**       | Local simulator                 | CRE gateway (`https://01.gateway.zone-a.cre.chain.link`) |
| **Use case**       | Development, testing, debugging | Live integrations, webhooks, production APIs             |

## Key concepts

### Authorization keys

Authorization keys are EVM addresses that are permitted to trigger your workflow. When you configure an HTTP trigger, you specify one or more `AuthorizedKeys`:

```go
AuthorizedKeys: []http.Key{
	{
		Type:      http.KeyTypeECDSAEVM,
		PublicKey: "0xYourEVMAddress",
	},
}
```

Only requests signed by the corresponding private keys will be accepted by the CRE gateway.

### Payload

The [HTTP trigger payload](/cre/reference/sdk/triggers/http-trigger-go#httppayload) contains:

- **`input`**: The JSON data from the HTTP request body
- **`key`**: The authorized key that signed the request

Your callback function receives this payload and can process the input data to perform workflow logic.
