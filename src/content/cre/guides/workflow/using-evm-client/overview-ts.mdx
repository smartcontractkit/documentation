The `EVMClient` is the TypeScript SDK's interface for interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains. It provides a simple, powerful, and type-safe way to read data from and write data to your onchain contracts through the underlying **[EVM Read & Write Capabilities](/cre/capabilities/evm-read-write)**.

## How it works

The TypeScript SDK uses **manual ABI definitions** with <a href="https://viem.sh/" target="_blank">viem</a> for contract interactions. This approach provides:

- Type-safe ABI encoding/decoding with viem
- No code generation required—just define ABIs as TypeScript constants
- Full TypeScript type inference for contract calls
- Synchronous-looking async operations with `.result()`
- Built-in helpers like `getNetwork()`, `bytesToHex()`, and chain selectors

This approach gives you the flexibility of direct ABI handling with the type safety of TypeScript and viem's powerful utilities.
