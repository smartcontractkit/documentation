<Aside type="note" title="Early Access required">
  Workflow deployment is currently in Early Access. To <a href="https://cre.chain.link/request-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request Early Access</a>, please share details about your project and use case—this helps us provide better support as you build with CRE.
  
  **While you wait:** Continue building and simulating workflows using [`cre workflow simulate`](/cre/guides/operations/simulating-workflows).
</Aside>

When you deploy a workflow, you take your locally tested code and register it with the onchain Workflow Registry contract. This makes your workflow "live" so it can activate and respond to triggers across a [Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)](/cre/key-terms#decentralized-oracle-network-don).

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy a workflow, you must have:

- **Early Access approval**: Workflow deployment is currently in Early Access. <a href="https://cre.chain.link/request-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Request access here</a> if you haven't already.
- **[Authenticated](/cre/reference/cli/authentication)**: Logged in via `cre login` or using an [API key](/cre/reference/cli/authentication#api-key-authentication) (`CRE_API_KEY`). To verify, run `cre whoami`.
- **[Linked your key](/cre/reference/cli/account#cre-account-link-key)**: Linked your EOA or multi-sig wallet to your account by running `cre account link-key`.
- **A funded wallet**: The account you are deploying from must be funded with ETH on Ethereum Mainnet to pay the gas fees for the onchain registration transaction to the Workflow Registry contract.

## The deployment process

The `cre workflow deploy` command handles the entire end-to-end process for you:

1. **Compiles** your workflow to a WASM binary.
1. **Uploads** the compiled binary and any associated configuration files (like your config file or `secrets.yaml`) to the CRE Storage Service.
1. **Registers** the workflow onchain by submitting a transaction to the Workflow Registry contract on **Ethereum Mainnet**. Your wallet must have ETH for gas fees, and your `project.yaml` must include an RPC configuration for `ethereum-mainnet` (e.g., `https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com`). This transaction contains the metadata for your workflow, including its name, owner, and the URL of its artifacts in the storage service.

<Aside type="caution" title="Early Access: Disclaimer">
Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) deployment is in the "Early Access" stage of development, which means that CRE currently has functionality which is under development and may be changed in later versions. By using CRE, you expressly acknowledge and agree to accept the Chainlink <a href="https://chain.link/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a>, which provides important information and disclosures.
</Aside>

### Step 1: Ensure your configuration is correct

Before deploying, ensure your `workflow.yaml` file is correctly configured. The `workflow-name` is required under the `user-workflow` section for your target environment.

If you are deploying from a multi-sig wallet, specify your multi-sig address in the `workflow-owner-address` field. If you are deploying from a standard EOA, you can leave this field unchanged—the owner will be automatically derived from the `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` in your `.env` file.

For more details on configuration, see the [Project Configuration](/cre/reference/project-configuration) reference.

### Step 2: Run the deploy command

**From your project root directory**, run the `deploy` command with the path to your workflow folder.

```bash
cre workflow deploy <workflow-folder-path> [flags]
```

Example command to target the `production-settings` environment:

```bash
cre workflow deploy my-workflow --target production-settings
```

**Available flags:**

| Flag             | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--target`       | Sets the target environment from your configuration files (e.g., `production-settings`) |
| `--output`       | The output file for the compiled WASM binary (default: `"./binary.wasm.br.b64"`)        |
| `--unsigned`     | Return the raw transaction instead of broadcasting it to the network                    |
| `--yes`          | Skip confirmation prompts and proceed with the operation                                |
| `--project-root` | Path to the project root directory                                                      |
| `--env`          | Path to your `.env` file (default: `".env"`)                                            |
| `--verbose`      | Enable verbose logging to print `DEBUG` level logs                                      |

### Step 3: Monitor the output

The CLI will provide detailed logs of the deployment process, including the compilation, upload to the CRE Storage Service, and the final onchain transaction.

```bash
> cre workflow deploy my-workflow --target production-settings

```

## Verifying your deployment

After a successful deployment, you can verify that your workflow was registered correctly in two ways:

1. **CRE UI**: View your deployed workflow in the [CRE platform](https://cre.chain.link). Navigate to the **Workflows** section to see your workflow's status, ID, and execution history.

1. **Block Explorer**: Check the Workflow Registry contract on a block explorer. The CLI output will provide the transaction hash for the registration. The `WorkflowRegistry` contract is deployed on **Ethereum Mainnet** at the address <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x4ac54353fa4fa961afcc5ec4b118596d3305e7e5#code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`0x4Ac54353FA4Fa961AfcC5ec4B118596d3305E7e5`</a>.

## Using multi-sig wallets

The `deploy` command supports multi-sig wallets through the `--unsigned` flag. When using this flag, the CLI generates raw transaction data that you can submit through your multi-sig wallet interface instead of sending the transaction directly.

For complete setup instructions, configuration requirements, and step-by-step guidance, see [Using Multi-sig Wallets](/cre/guides/operations/using-multisig-wallets).
