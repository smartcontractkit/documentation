After deploying a workflow, you can control its operational state using the `cre workflow activate` and `cre workflow pause` commands. These commands modify the workflow's status in the Workflow Registry contract, determining whether it can respond to triggers.

**Workflow states:**

- **Active** — The workflow can respond to its configured triggers and execute
- **Paused** — The workflow cannot respond to triggers and will not execute

## Prerequisites

Before activating or pausing workflows, ensure you have:

- **A [deployed workflow](/cre/guides/operations/deploying-workflows)**: You must have a workflow that has been successfully deployed to the Workflow Registry.
- **Workflow ownership**: You must be the owner of the workflow (the account that originally deployed it). Only the workflow owner can activate or pause it.
- **Local workflow folder**: You must run these commands from your project directory. The CLI reads the workflow name and configuration from your `workflow.yaml` file to identify which workflow to activate or pause.
- **[Logged in](/cre/reference/cli/authentication#cre-login)**: Authenticated with the platform by running `cre login`. To check your authentication status, run `cre whoami`.
- **A funded wallet**: The account you are using must be funded with ETH on Ethereum Mainnet to pay the gas fees for the onchain transaction to the Workflow Registry contract.

## Activating a workflow

The `cre workflow activate` command changes a paused workflow's status to active, allowing its triggers to fire and the workflow to execute.

### When to activate

You typically use `activate` after pausing a workflow to resume execution after maintenance or debugging.

### Usage

Run the command from your project root:

```bash
cre workflow activate my-workflow --target production-settings
```

The CLI identifies which workflow to activate based on:

- `workflow-name` from your `workflow.yaml` file
- `workflow-owner-address` (either from `workflow.yaml` or derived from your private key in `.env`)

### What happens during activation

1. The CLI fetches the workflow matching your workflow name and owner address
1. It validates that the workflow is currently paused
1. If valid, it sends an onchain transaction to change the status to active

### Example output

```bash
> cre workflow activate my-workflow --target production-settings

Activating Workflow :    my-workflow
Target :                 production-settings
Owner Address :          <your-owner-address>

## Pausing a workflow

The `cre workflow pause` command changes an active workflow's status to paused, preventing its triggers from firing and stopping execution.

### When to pause

Pause workflows when you need to:

- **Perform maintenance**: Temporarily stop execution while updating dependencies or configuration
- **Debug issues**: Halt execution to investigate errors or unexpected behavior
- **Temporarily halt operations**: Stop workflow execution without permanently deleting it

### Usage

Run the command from your project root:

```bash
cre workflow pause my-workflow --target production-settings
```

### What happens during pausing

1. The CLI fetches the workflow matching your workflow name and owner address
1. It validates that the workflow is currently active
1. If valid, it sends an onchain transaction to change the status to paused

### Example output

```bash
> cre workflow pause my-workflow --target production-settings

<Aside type="note" title="Missed triggers are not queued">
  Triggers that would have fired while a workflow was paused are **not queued or retroactively executed**. When you activate the workflow again, it will only respond to new triggers that occur after activation.

## Using multi-sig wallets

Both `activate` and `pause` commands support multi-sig wallets through the `--unsigned` flag. When using this flag, the CLI generates raw transaction data that you can submit through your multi-sig wallet interface instead of sending the transaction directly.

For complete setup instructions, configuration requirements, and step-by-step guidance, see [Using Multi-sig Wallets](/cre/guides/operations/using-multisig-wallets).
