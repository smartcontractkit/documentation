This page explains how to install the CRE CLI on macOS or Linux. The recommended version at the time of writing is **v1.0.0**.

## Installation

Choose your installation method:

- **[Automatic installation](#automatic-installation)** - Quick setup with a single command
- **[Manual installation](#manual-installation)** - Download and install the binary yourself

### Automatic installation

The easiest way to install the CRE CLI is using the installation script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://cre.chain.link/install.sh | sh
```

This script will:

- Detect your operating system and architecture automatically
- Download the correct binary for your system
- Verify the binary's integrity
- Install it to `/usr/local/bin` (or prompt you for a custom location)
- Make the binary executable

After the script completes, verify the installation:

```bash
cre version
```

**Expected output:** `cre version v1.0.0`

### Manual installation

If you prefer to install manually or the automatic installation doesn't work for your environment, follow these steps:

The CRE CLI is publicly available on GitHub. Visit the releases page and download the appropriate binary archive for your operating system and architecture.

<Aside title="Which file should I download?">
The file you need depends on your operating system and CPU architecture:

- On **macOS** (darwin), run <CopyText text="uname -m" code />:
  - `arm64` (Apple Silicon) → Download `cre_darwin_arm64.zip`
  - `x86_64` (Intel) → Download `cre_darwin_amd64.zip`
- On **Linux**, run <CopyText text="uname -m" code />:
  - `aarch64` (ARM) → Download `cre_linux_arm64.tar.gz`
  - `x86_64` (AMD/Intel) → Download `cre_linux_amd64.tar.gz`

</Aside>

After downloading the correct file from the releases page, move on to the next step to verify its integrity.

#### 1. Verify file integrity

Before installing, verify the file integrity using a checksum to ensure the binary hasn't been tampered with:

**Check the SHA-256 checksum**

Run the following command in the directory where you downloaded the archive (replace the filename with your specific binary):

```bash
shasum -a 256 cre_darwin_arm64.zip
```

**Verify against official checksums**

Compare the output with the official checksum below:

| <div style="width: 200px;">File</div> | SHA-256 Checksum                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cre_darwin_amd64.zip`                | <CopyText text="be7d595a87ae74ecbbde95a576d4117c88af9d6751191fa7098bd0fe1f75a226" code /> |
| `cre_darwin_arm64.zip`                | <CopyText text="2b1ca0992d2c7a70ece60623a1490155b74e04041722caf0bcc2f4c795686ebf" code /> |
| `cre_linux_amd64.tar.gz`              | <CopyText text="dab1e966fbbf67ec136d7f3ec1236028db93493a067cdc8a772fb105593b2773" code /> |
| `cre_linux_arm64.tar.gz`              | <CopyText text="e1f6a51010f4b2c73825eba2f703a8164972a56643891f91bfeddbfeecc32e34" code /> |

If the checksum doesn't match, do not proceed with installation. Contact your Chainlink point of contact for assistance.

#### 2. Extract and install

1. **Navigate** to the directory where you downloaded the archive.

1. **Extract the archive**

   For `.tar.gz` files:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf cre_linux_arm64.tar.gz
   ```

   For `.zip` files:

   ```bash
   unzip cre_darwin_arm64.zip
   ```

1. **Rename the extracted binary to `cre`**

   ```bash
   mv cre_v1.0.0_darwin_arm64 cre
   ```

1. **Make it executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x cre
   ```
   **Note (macOS Gatekeeper)**: If you see warnings about "unrecognized developer/source", remove extended attributes:
   ```bash
   xattr -c cre
   ```

#### 3. Add the CLI to your PATH

Now that you have the `cre` binary, you need to make it accessible from anywhere on your system. This means you can run `cre` commands from any directory, not just where the binary is located.

**Recommended approach: Move to a standard location**

The easiest and most reliable method is to move the `cre` binary to a directory that's already in your system's PATH. For example:

```bash
sudo mv cre /usr/local/bin/
```

This command moves the `cre` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`, which is typically included in your PATH by default.

**Alternative: Add current directory to PATH**

If you prefer to keep the binary in its current location, you can add that directory to your PATH:

1. **Find your current directory:**

   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

   Note the full path (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Downloads/cre`)

1. **Add to your shell profile** (choose based on your shell):

   For **zsh** (default on newer macOS):

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="/Users/yourname/Downloads/cre:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   For **bash**:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="/Users/yourname/Downloads/cre:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   Replace `/Users/yourname/Downloads/cre` with your actual directory path from step 1.

1. **For temporary access** (this session only):
   ```bash
   export PATH="$(pwd):$PATH"
   ```

#### 4. Verify the installation

**Test that `cre` is accessible:**

Open a **new terminal window** and run:

```bash
cre version
```

**Expected output:**

You should see version information: `cre version v1.0.0`.

**If it doesn't work:**

- Make sure you opened a **new terminal window** after making PATH changes
- Check the binary location: `which cre` should return `/usr/local/bin/cre` (or your custom path)
- Check that the binary has execute permissions: `ls -la /usr/local/bin/cre`
- Verify your PATH includes the correct directory: `echo $PATH`

#### 5. Confirm your PATH (troubleshooting)

If you're having issues, check what directories are in your PATH:

```bash
echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n'
```

You should see either:

- `/usr/local/bin` (if you moved the binary there)
- Your custom directory (if you added it to PATH)

## Next steps

Now that you have the `cre` CLI installed, you'll need to create a CRE account and authenticate before you can use it.

- **[Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account)**: Create your CRE account and set up two-factor authentication
- **[Logging in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login)**: Authenticate the CLI with your account

Once you're authenticated, you're ready to build your first workflow:

- **[Getting Started — Part 1: Project Setup & Simulation](/cre/getting-started/part-1-project-setup)**: Initialize a new, blank CRE project and run your first "Hello World!" simulation.
