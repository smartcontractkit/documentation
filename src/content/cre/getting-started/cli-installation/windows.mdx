This page explains how to install the Chainlink Developer Platform CLI (also referred to as the CRE CLI) on Windows. The recommended version at the time of writing is **v1.1.0**.

## Installation

Choose your installation method:

- **[Automatic installation](#automatic-installation)** - Quick setup with a PowerShell script
- **[Manual installation](#manual-installation)** - Download and install the binary yourself

### Automatic installation

The easiest way to install the CRE CLI is using the installation script. Open **PowerShell** and run:

```powershell
irm https://cre.chain.link/install.ps1 | iex
```

This script will:

- Download the correct binary for Windows
- Verify the binary's integrity
- Install it to `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\cre`
- Make the binary executable

After the script completes, **open a new PowerShell window** and verify the installation:

```powershell
cre version
```

**Expected output:** `CRE CLI version v1.1.0`

### Manual installation

If you prefer to install manually or the automatic installation doesn't work for your environment, follow these steps:

The CRE CLI is publicly available on GitHub. Click the button below to access the releases page and download `cre_windows_amd64.zip`.

  <DownloadButton client:load />

After downloading the file from the releases page, move on to the next step to verify its integrity.

#### 1. Verify file integrity

Before installing, verify the file integrity using a checksum to ensure the binary hasn't been tampered with.

**Check the SHA-256 checksum**

Open a PowerShell terminal and run the following command in the directory where you downloaded the archive:

```powershell
Get-FileHash cre_windows_amd64.zip -Algorithm SHA256
```

**Verify against the official checksum**

Compare the `Hash` value in the output with the official checksum from the [CRE CLI releases page](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-cli/releases):

1. Go to https://github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-cli/releases
2. Find the release version you downloaded (e.g., v1.0.11)
3. Under the **Assets** section, locate `cre_windows_amd64.zip`
4. Compare the SHA-256 checksum shown next to the file with the `Hash` value from your PowerShell output

**Example:** For `cre_windows_amd64.zip` in release v1.0.11, you'll see something like:

```
cre_windows_amd64.zip
sha256:372d16566479ff6bbfe9eb1d5cebe0e1e2a3c67062c6f0439fc96c735ddeaa18
```

If the checksums match, the file is authentic and safe to install. If they don't match, do not proceed with installation and contact the Chainlink team for assistance.

#### 2. Extract and install

1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the archive.
1. Right-click the `.zip` file and select **Extract All...**.
1. Choose a permanent location for the extracted folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\cre-cli`).
1. Inside the extracted folder, rename the file `cre_v1.0.11_windows_amd64.exe` to `cre.exe`.

#### 3. Add the CLI to your PATH

To run `cre` commands from any directory, you need to add the folder where you saved `cre.exe` to your system's PATH environment variable.

1. Open the **Start Menu** and search for "environment variables".
1. Select **Edit the system environment variables**.
1. In the System Properties window, click the **Environment Variables...** button.
1. In the **System variables** section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click **Edit...**.
1. Click **New** and add the full path to the folder where you saved `cre.exe` (e.g., `C:\Program Files\cre-cli`).
1. Click **OK** on all windows to save your changes.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  You must open a **new** terminal window for the PATH changes to take effect.
</Aside>

#### 4. Verify the installation

Open a new **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** window and run:

```bash
cre version
```

You should see version information: `cre version v1.0.11`.

## Next steps

Now that you have the `cre` CLI installed, you'll need to create a CRE account and authenticate before you can use it.

- **[Creating Your Account](/cre/account/creating-account)**: Create your CRE account and set up two-factor authentication
- **[Logging in with the CLI](/cre/account/cli-login)**: Authenticate the CLI with your account

Once you're authenticated, you're ready to build your first workflow:

- **[Getting Started — Part 1: Project Setup & Simulation](/cre/getting-started/part-1-project-setup)**: Initialize a new, blank CRE project and run your first "Hello World!" simulation.
