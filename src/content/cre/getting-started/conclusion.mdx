You've built a complete, end-to-end CRE workflow from scratch.

You started with an empty project and progressively built a workflow that:

- Fetches data from an offchain API with consensus
- Reads values from a smart contract
- Performs calculations combining onchain and offchain data
- Writes results back to the blockchain

**This is no small achievement.** You've mastered the core pattern that powers most CRE workflows: the trigger-and-callback model with capabilities for HTTP, EVM, and consensus.

## What's next?

Now that you have a working workflow, here's your natural progression from simulation to production and beyond.

### 1. See a complete example

Ready to see all these concepts in a more complex, real-world scenario?

- **[Run the Custom Data Feed Demo](/cre/templates/running-demo-workflow)** - Explore an advanced template that combines multiple capabilities

**Why this matters:** Templates show production-ready patterns.

### 2. Deploy your Calculator workflow to Production

You've simulated your workflow locally. **The logical next step is to deploy it to the CRE production environment** so it runs across a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON).

<Aside type="note" title="Deployment access required">
  - Deploying workflows requires Early Access approval. If you don't have deployment access yet, <a href="https://cre.chain.link/request-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request it here</a>.
  - **While you wait:** Continue building and simulating workflows using [`cre workflow simulate`](/cre/guides/operations/simulating-workflows).
</Aside>

**Follow this deployment sequence:**

1. **[Link a Wallet Key](/cre/organization/linking-keys)** - Connect your wallet address to your organization (required before deployment)
1. **[Deploy Your Workflow](/cre/guides/operations/deploying-workflows)** - Push your calculator workflow live
1. **[Monitor Your Workflow](/cre/guides/operations/monitoring-workflows)** - Watch it execute in production and debug any issues

**Why this matters:** Deploying moves your workflow from local simulation to production execution across a DON.

### 3. Explore different triggers

You used a **Cron trigger** (time-based). **Most production workflows react to real-world events.**

**Try these next:**

- **[HTTP Trigger](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/http-trigger)** - Let external systems trigger your workflow via API calls
- **[EVM Log Trigger](/cre/guides/workflow/using-triggers/evm-log-trigger)** - React to onchain events (e.g., token transfers, contract events)

**Why this matters:** Event-driven workflows are more powerful than scheduled ones. They respond instantly to real-world changes.

### 4. Add secrets

Your calculator used a public API. **Real workflows often need API keys and other sensitive data.**

**Learn how to secure your secrets:**

- **[Using Secrets in Simulation](/cre/guides/workflow/secrets/using-secrets-simulation)** - Store secrets in your local environment for development
- **[Using Secrets with Deployed Workflows](/cre/guides/workflow/secrets/using-secrets-deployed)** - Store secrets in the Vault DON for production
- **[Managing Secrets with 1Password](/cre/guides/workflow/secrets/managing-secrets-1password)** - Best practice: inject secrets at runtime

**Why this matters:** Hardcoded credentials are a security risk. CRE's secrets management lets you safely use authenticated APIs and private keys.

### 5. Build your own consumer contract

You used a **pre-deployed consumer contract**. **For production workflows, you'll create custom contracts tailored to your use case.**

**Learn the secure pattern:**

- **[Building Consumer Contracts](/cre/guides/workflow/using-evm-client/onchain-write/building-consumer-contracts)** - Create contracts that safely receive CRE data

**Why this matters:** Consumer contracts enforce business logic and validation onchain, enabling trustless and verifiable execution.
