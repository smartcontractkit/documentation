<Aside type="note" title="First time here?">
  Before you begin, we strongly recommend reading the [**About CRE**](/cre/) page to understand the fundamental concepts
  of the platform, such as the trigger-and-callback model.
</Aside>

This multi-part tutorial guides you through building a complete workflow from a blank slate.

### What you'll build

You will build a simple but powerful **"Onchain Calculator"** workflow. By the end of this tutorial, your workflow will:

1.  Run on a schedule using the **Cron Trigger**.
1.  Fetch a random number from a public API using the **HTTP Capability**.
1.  Read a value from a smart contract using the **EVM Read Capability**.
1.  Combine the two values and write the final result back to the blockchain using the **EVM Write Capability**.

This tutorial is designed to teach you the core features of the CRE SDK in a logical progression. You can use any of the supported languages, Go or TypeScript using the language selector. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of the end-to-end development process for building and simulating workflows that interact with both offchain and onchain data sources.

### Where to go next?

- **[Installing the CLI](/cre/getting-started/cli-installation)**: Download and install the `cre` command-line tool.

#### Tutorial structure

- **[Part 1: Project Setup & Simulation](/cre/getting-started/part-1-project-setup)**: Initialize a new, blank CRE project and run your first "Hello World!" simulation.

- **[Part 2: Fetching Offchain Data](/cre/getting-started/part-2-fetching-data)**: Modify your workflow to fetch data from an external API using the `http.Client`.

- **[Part 3: Reading an Onchain Value](/cre/getting-started/part-3-reading-onchain-value)**: Generate contract bindings and use the `evm.Client` to read a value from the blockchain.

- **[Part 4: Writing Onchain](/cre/getting-started/part-4-writing-onchain)**: Complete the calculator by writing your computed result back to a smart contract on Sepolia.

- **[Conclusion](/cre/getting-started/conclusion)**: Review what you've learned and find resources to continue your journey.
