<Aside type="note" title="Explore Chainlink Functions Playground">
  Start exploring Chainlink Functions in your browser using the [Chainlink Functions
  Playground](https://functions.chain.link/playground). You can use the playground to simulate Chainlink Functions, call
  APIs, and execute demo requests.
</Aside>

Learn how to integrate the [Chainlink Functions NPM package](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit) to your own JavaScript or TypeScript project, then make requests to the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). Chainlink Functions is available on several blockchains (see the [supported networks page](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks)), but this guide uses Polygon Mumbai to simplify access to testnet funds. Complete the following tasks to get started with Chainlink Functions:

- Set up your Web3 wallet and find your private key.
- Install the required frameworks.
- Configure your project with your environment variables.
- Simulate a Chainlink Functions request.
- Send a Chainlink Functions request to the DON.

## Set up your environment

You must provide the private key from a testnet wallet to run the examples in this documentation. Install a Web3 wallet, configure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), clone the [smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git) repository, and configure a `.env.enc` file with the required environment variables.

Install and configure your Web3 wallet for Polygon Mumbai:

1. [Install Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) so you can compile and simulate your Functions source code.

1. [Install the MetaMask wallet](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) or other Ethereum Web3 wallet.

1. Set the network for your wallet to the Polygon Mumbai testnet. If you need to add Mumbai to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#mumbai-testnet) page.

   - <a
       class="erc-token-address"
       id="80001_0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB"
       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#mumbai-testnet"
     >
       Polygon Mumbai testnet and LINK token contract
     </a>

1. Request testnet MATIC from the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

1. Request testnet LINK from [faucets.chain.link/mumbai](https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai).

Install the required frameworks and dependencies:

1. [Install the latest release of Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Optionally, you can use the [nvm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) to switch between Node.js versions with `nvm use 18`.

   **Note**: To ensure you are running the correct version in a terminal, type `node -v`.

   ```shell
   node -v
   ```

   ```shell
   $ node -v
   v18.18.0
   ```

1. In a terminal, clone the [smart-contract examples](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git) repository and change directories. This example repository imports the [Chainlink Functions Toolkit NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/functions-toolkit). You can import this package to your own projects to enable them to work with Chainlink Functions.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git && \
   cd ./smart-contract-examples/functions-examples/
   ```

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

1. For higher security, the examples repository encrypts your environment variables at rest.

   1. Set an encryption password for your environment variables.

      ```shell
      npx env-enc set-pw
      ```

   1. Run `npx env-enc set` to configure a `.env.enc` file with the basic variables that you need to send your requests to the Polygon Mumbai network.

      - `POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL`: Set a URL for the Polygon Mumbai testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

      - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Find the private key for your testnet wallet. If you use MetaMask, follow the instructions to [Export a Private Key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key). **Note**: Your private key is needed to sign any transactions you make such as making requests.

      ```shell
      npx env-enc set
      ```

## Configure your on-chain resources

After you configure your local environment, configure some on-chain resources to process your requests, receive the responses, and pay for the work done by the DON.

### Deploy a Functions consumer contract on _Polygon Mumbai_

1. [Open the FunctionsConsumerExample.sol contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerExample.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerExample.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

1. Compile the contract.
1. Open MetaMask and select the _Polygon Mumbai_ network.
1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Polygon Mumbai_.
1. Under the **Deploy** section, fill in the router address for your specific blockchain. You can find both of these addresses on the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page. For _Polygon Mumbai_, the router address is <CopyText text="0x6E2dc0F9DB014aE19888F539E59285D2Ea04244C" code/>.
1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract to _Polygon Mumbai_.
1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Copy the contract address.

### Create a subscription

Follow the [Managing Functions Subscriptions](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#create-a-subscription) guide to accept the Chainlink Functions Terms of Service (ToS), create a subscription, fund it, then add your consumer contract address to it.

You can find the Chainlink Functions UI at [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link/).

## Run the example

The example in this guide gets the sum of a list of numbers `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9`. Read the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section for a detailed description of all of the components.

To run the example:

1. Open the file `getting-started.js`, which is located in the `examples` folder.
1. Replace the consumer contract address and the subscription ID with your own values.

   ```javascript
   const consumerAddress = "0x8dFf78B7EE3128D00E90611FBeD20A71397064D9" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
   const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
   ```

1. Make a request:

   ```shell
   node examples/getting-started.js
   ```

   Example:

   ```text
   $ node examples/getting-started.js
   secp256k1 unavailable, reverting to browser version

   Make a Chainlink Functions request...

     returnDataBytesHexstring: '0x',
     fulfillmentCode: 0
   }

   ✅ Decoded response to int256:  45n
   ```

   The output of the example gives you the following information:

   - Your request was succesfully sent to Chainlink Functions. The transaction in this example is [0x3926c468bd3add2bfbae24abc488927497424c30a0229a3fa2af44465dafe398](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x3926c468bd3add2bfbae24abc488927497424c30a0229a3fa2af44465dafe398).
   - The request ID is `0x2648e1085699fa111cc2b48b59b1aa209cb2f9947d873d522792adb94e1134dd`.

   - The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.00003738791938044 LINK`.
   - The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002d`. Decoding it off-chain to `int256` give you a result: `45` (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9).

Chainlink Functions is capable of much more than just computation. Try one of the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) to see examples that can GET and POST to public APIs, securely handle API secrets, handle custom responses, and query multiple APIs.

## Examine the code

### FunctionsConsumerExample.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### getting-started.js

This explanation focuses on the [getting-started.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/getting-started.js) script and shows how to use the [Chainlink Functions NPM package](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit) in your own JavaScript/TypeScript project to send requests to a DON. The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

The script imports:

- [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/): Ethers.js library, enables the script to interact with the blockchain.
- `@chainlink/functions-toolkit`: Chainlink Functions NPM package. All its utilities are documented in the [NPM README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit/blob/main/README.md).
- `@chainlink/env-enc`: A tool for loading and storing encrypted environment variables. Read the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc) to learn more.
- `../abi/functionsClient.json`: The abi of the contract your script will interact with. **Note**: The script was tested with this [FunctionsConsumerExample contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerExample.sol).

The script has two hardcoded values that you have to change using your own Functions consumer contract and subscription ID:

```javascript
const consumerAddress = "0x8dFf78B7EE3128D00E90611FBeD20A71397064D9" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
```

The primary function that the script executes is `makeRequestMumbai`. This function can be broken into three main parts:

1. Define the necessary identifiers:

   - `routerAddress`: Chainlink Functions router address on Polygon Mumbai.
   - `donId`: Identifier of the DON that will fulfill your requests on Polygon Mumbai.
   - `explorerUrl`: Block explorer url of Polygon Mumbai.
   - `source`: The javascript source code that will send in your request. This code calculates the sum of an array of integers provided as input arguments. It performs input validation to ensure that the arguments are numbers and throws errors if not. The final sum is then returned as a 32-bytes buffer using the `Functions.encodeInt256` helper function. Here are the supported return types:
     - `Functions.encodeUint256`: Takes a positive JavaScript integer number and returns a Buffer of 32 bytes representing a uint256 type in Solidity.
     - `Functions.encodeInt256`: Takes a JavaScript integer number and returns a Buffer of 32 bytes representing an int256 type in Solidity.
     - `Functions.encodeString`: Takes a JavaScript string and returns a Buffer representing a string type in Solidity.
   - `args`: During the execution of your function, These arguments are passed to the source code.
   - `gasLimit`: Maximum gas that Chainlink Functions can use when transmitting the response to your contract.

1. Making a request to Chainlink Functions:

   - Initialization of ethers `signer` and `provider` objects. The signer is used to make transactions on the blockchain, and the provider reads data from the blockchain.
   - Initialization of your functions consumer contract using the contract address, abi, and ethers signer.
   - Make a [static call](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-callStatic) to the `sendRequest` function of your consumer contract to return the request ID that Chainlink Functions will generate.
   - Call the `sendRequest` function of your consumer contract.

1. Await the response:

   - Initialize a `ResponseListener` from the Functions NPM package and then call the `listenForResponse` function to wait for a response. By default, this function waits for five minutes.
   - Upon reception of the response, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.int256` in this example).
