Learn how to make requests to the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) and make any computation or API calls offchain. Chainlink Functions is available on several blockchains (see the [supported networks page](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks)), but this guide uses Sepolia to simplify access to testnet funds. Complete the following tasks to get started with Chainlink Functions:

- Set up your web3 wallet and fund it with testnet tokens.
- Simulate a Chainlink Functions on the [Chainlink Functions
  Playground](https://functions.chain.link/playground).
- Send a Chainlink Functions request to the DON. The JavaScript source code makes an API call to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.info) and fetches the name of a given character.
- Receive the response from Chainlink Functions and parse the result.

## Simulation

Before making a Chainlink Functions request from your smart contract, it is always a good practice to simulate the source code offchain to make any adjustments or corrections.

1. Open the [Functions playground](https://functions.chain.link/playground).
1. Copy and paste the following source code into the playground's code block.

   <CodeSample lang="javascript" src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/starwars-api.js" />

1. Under _Argument_, set the first argument to <CopyText text="1" code/>. You are going to fetch the name of the first Star Wars character.
1. Click on _Run code_. Under _Output_, you should see _Luke Skywalker_.

## Configure your resources

### Configure your wallet

You will test on Sepolia, so you must have an Ethereum web3 wallet with enough testnet ETH and LINK tokens. Testnet ETH is the native gas fee token on Sepolia. You will use testnet ETH tokens to pay for gas whenever you make a transaction on Sepolia. On the other hand, you will use LINK tokens to pay the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracles Network (DON) for processing your request.

1. [Install the MetaMask wallet](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) or other Ethereum web3 wallet.

1. Set the network for your wallet to the Sepolia testnet. If you need to add Sepolia to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#sepolia-testnet) page.

   - <a
       class="erc-token-address"
       id="11155111_0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789"
       href="/resources/link-token-contracts#sepolia-testnet"
     >
       Sepolia testnet and LINK token contract
     </a>

1. Request testnet LINK and ETH from [faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).

### Deploy a Functions consumer contract on Sepolia

1. Open the [GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol) contract in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

1. Compile the contract.
1. Open MetaMask and select the _Sepolia_ network.
1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Sepolia_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/injected-provider.jpg" />

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract to _Sepolia_.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/deploy.jpg" />

1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Copy the contract address and save it for later. You will use this address with a Functions Subscription.

   <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/deployed-contracts.jpg" />

### Create a subscription

You use a Chainlink Functions subscription to pay for, manage, and track Functions requests.

1. Go to [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link/).

1. Click **Connect wallet**:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/frontend-landing.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription landing page"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Read and accept the Chainlink Foundation Terms of Service. Then click **MetaMask**.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/accept-CL-foundation-tos.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions accept ToS"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Make sure your wallet is connected to the _Sepolia_ testnet. If not, click the network name in the top right corner of the page and select _Sepolia_.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/wallet-connected-ethereum-sepolia.webp"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription landing page"
   />

1. Click **Create Subscription**:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/frontend-landing-wallet-connected.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription landing page"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Provide an email address and an optional subscription name:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/create-subscription.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions create subscription"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. The first time you interact with the Subscription Manager using your EOA, you must accept the Terms of Service (ToS). A MetaMask popup appears and you are asked to accept the ToS:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/acceptTos.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions accept ToS"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. After you approve the ToS, another MetaMask popup appears, and you are asked to approve the subscription creation:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/approve-create-subscription.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions approve subscriptions creation"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. After the subscription is created, MetaMask prompts you to sign a message that links the subscription name and email address to your subscription:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/sign-message-tos.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions sign message ToS"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/sign-message-tos-metamask.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions sign message ToS MetaMask"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

### Fund your subscription

1. After the subscription is created, the Functions UI prompts you to fund your subscription. Click **Add funds**:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/subscription-created.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription created"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. For this example, add 2 LINK and click **Add funds**:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/subscription-created-add-funds.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription add funds"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

### Add a consumer to your subscription

1. After you fund your subscription, add your consumer to it. Specify the address for the consumer contract that you deployed earlier and click **Add consumer**. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/subscription-created-add-consumer.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription add consumer"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

   <ClickToZoom

     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription add consumer"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

1. Subscription creation and configuration is complete. You can always see the details of your subscription again at [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link):

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/subscription-details-after-creation.jpg"
     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription details"
     style="max-width: 70%;"
   />

## Run the example

The example is hardcoded to communicate with Chainlink Functions on Sepolia. After this example is run, you can examine the code and see a detailed description of all components.

1.  In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, expand your contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
1.  Expand the `sendRequest` function to display its parameters.
1.  Fill in the `subscriptionId` with your subscription ID and `args` with `[1]`. You can find your subscription ID on the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager at [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link/). The `[1]` value for `args` specifies which argument in the response will be retrieved.

1.  Click the **transact** button.

    <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/send-request.jpg" />

1.  Wait for the request to be fulfilled. You can monitor the status of your request on the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager.

    <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/request-fulfilled.png" />

1.  Refresh the Functions UI to get the latest request status.

1.  After the status is _Success_, check the character name. In Remix, under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, click the `character` function. If the transaction and request ran correctly, you will see the name of your character in the response.

    <ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/getting-started/character.jpg" />

Chainlink Functions is capable of much more than just retrieving data. Try one of the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) to see examples that can GET and POST to public APIs, securely handle API secrets, handle custom responses, and query multiple APIs.

## Examine the code

### Solidity code

<CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol" />

- To write a Chainlink Functions consumer contract, your contract must import [FunctionsClient.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsClient.sol) and [FunctionsRequest.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/libraries/FunctionsRequest.sol). You can read the API references: [FunctionsClient](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client) and [FunctionsRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request).

  These contracts are available in an NPM package so that you can import them from within your project.

  ```
  import {FunctionsClient} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsClient.sol";
  import {FunctionsRequest} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/libraries/FunctionsRequest.sol";
  ```

- Use the FunctionsRequest.sol library to get all the functions needed for building a Chainlink Functions request.

  ```
  using FunctionsRequest for FunctionsRequest.Request;
  ```

- The latest request ID, latest received response, and latest received error (if any) are defined as state variables:

  ```
  bytes32 public s_lastRequestId;
  bytes public s_lastResponse;
  bytes public s_lastError;
  ```

- We define the `Response` event that your smart contract will emit during the callback

  ```
  event Response(bytes32 indexed requestId, string character, bytes response, bytes err);
  ```

- The Chainlink Functions router address and donID are hardcoded for Sepolia. Check the [supported networks page](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) to try the code sample on another testnet.

- The `gasLimit` is hardcoded to `300000`, the amount of gas that Chainlink Functions will use to fulfill your request.

- The JavaScript source code is hardcoded in the `source` state variable. For more explanation, read the [JavaScript code section](#javascript-code).

- Pass the router address for your network when you deploy the contract:

  ```
  constructor() FunctionsClient(router)
  ```

- The two remaining functions are:

  - `sendRequest` for sending a request. It receives the subscription ID and list of arguments to pass to the source code. Then:

    - It uses the `FunctionsRequest` library to initialize the request and add the source code and arguments. You can read the API Reference for [Initializing a request](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request/#initializerequestforinlinejavascript) and [adding arguments](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request/#setargs).

      ```
      FunctionsRequest.Request memory req;
      req.initializeRequestForInlineJavaScript(source);
      if (args.length > 0) req.setArgs(args);
      ```

    - It sends the request to the router by calling the `FunctionsClient` `sendRequest` function. You can read the API reference for [sending a request](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client/#_sendrequest). Finally, it stores the request id in `s_lastRequestId` and returns it.

      ```
      s_lastRequestId = _sendRequest(
          req.encodeCBOR(),
          subscriptionId,
          gasLimit,
          jobId
      );
      return s_lastRequestId;
      ```

      **Note**: `_sendRequest` accepts requests encoded in `bytes`. Therefore, you must encode it using [encodeCBOR](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request/#encodecbor).

- `fulfillRequest` to be invoked during the callback. This function is defined in `FunctionsClient` as `virtual` (read `fulfillRequest` [API reference](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client/#fulfillrequest)). So, your smart contract must override the function to implement the callback. The implementation of the callback is straightforward: the contract stores the latest response and error in `s_lastResponse` and `s_lastError`, parses the `response` from `bytes` to `string` to fetch the character name before emitting the `Response` event.

  ```
  s_lastResponse = response;
  character = string(response);
  s_lastError = err;
  emit Response(requestId, s_lastResponse, s_lastError);
  ```

### JavaScript code

<CodeSample lang="javascript" src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/starwars-api.js" />

This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#http-requests) to make HTTP requests. The source code calls the `https://swapi.info/` API to request a Star Wars character name. If you read the [Functions.makeHttpRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#http-requests) documentation and the [Star Wars API documentation](https://swapi.info/people), you notice that URL has the following format where `$characterId` is provided as parameter when making the HTTP request:

```
url: `https://swapi.info/api/people/${characterId}/`
```

To check the expected API response for the first character, you can directly paste the following URL in your browser `https://swapi.info/api/people/1/` or run the `curl` command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://swapi.info/api/people/1/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The response should be similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "name": "Luke Skywalker",
  "height": "172",
  "mass": "77",
  "hair_color": "blond",
  "skin_color": "fair",
  "eye_color": "blue",
  "birth_year": "19BBY",
  "gender": "male",
  "homeworld": "https://swapi.info/api/planets/1/",
  "films": [
    "https://swapi.info/api/films/1/",
    "https://swapi.info/api/films/2/",
    "https://swapi.info/api/films/3/",
    "https://swapi.info/api/films/6/"
  ],
  "species": [],
  "vehicles": ["https://swapi.info/api/vehicles/14/", "https://swapi.info/api/vehicles/30/"],
  "starships": ["https://swapi.info/api/starships/12/", "https://swapi.info/api/starships/22/"],
  "created": "2014-12-09T13:50:51.644000Z",
  "edited": "2014-12-20T21:17:56.891000Z",
  "url": "https://swapi.info/api/people/1/"
}
```

Now that you understand the structure of the API. Let's delve into the JavaScript code. The main steps are:

- Fetch `characterId` from `args`. Args is an array. The `characterId` is located in the first element.
- Make the HTTP call using `Functions.makeHttpRequest` and store the response in `apiResponse`.
- Throw an error if the call is not successful.
- The API response is located at `data`.
- Read the name from the API response `data.name` and return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.encodeString` helper function. Because the `name` is a `string`, we use `encodeString`. For other data types, you can use different [data encoding functions](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#data-encoding-functions).
  **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.
