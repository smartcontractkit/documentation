This tutorial demonstrates how to import modules and use them with your Functions source code. Modules that are imported into Functions source code must meet the following requirements:

- Each import must be 10 MB or less in size.
- Up to 100 imports total are supported.
- Deno supports [ESM compatible NPM imports](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/npm_specifiers) and some [standard Node modules](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/node_specifiers). See the [Compatability List](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/compatibility) for details.
- Third-party modules are imported at runtime, so import statements must use asynchronous logic like the following examples:

  - Importing from `deno.land`:

    ```javascript
    const { escape } = await import("https://deno.land/std/regexp/mod.ts")
    ```

  - ESM-compatible packages:

    ```javascript
    const { format } = await import("npm:date-fns")
    ```

  - Standard Node modules:

    ```javascript
    const path = await import("node:path")
    ```

  - CDN imports:

    ```javascript
    const lodash = await import("http://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash")
    ```

- Imported modules abide by all sandbox restrictions and do not have access to the file system, environment variables, or any other Deno permissions.

## Tutorial

This example imports [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers) and demonstrates how to call a smart contract functions using a JSON RPC provider to call an onchain function. In this example, the source code calls the [`latestRoundData()` function](/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata) from the `AggregatorV3Interface`. Read the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section for a detailed description of the code example.

You can locate the scripts used in this tutorial in the [_examples/11-package-imports_ directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/functions-examples/examples/11-package-imports).

To run the example:

1. Open the file `request.js`, which is located in the `11-package-imports` folder.
1. Replace the consumer contract address and the subscription ID with your own values.

   ```javascript
   const consumerAddress = "0x8dFf78B7EE3128D00E90611FBeD20A71397064D9" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
   const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
   ```

1. Make a request:

   ```shell
   node examples/11-package-imports/request.js
   ```

   The script runs your function in a sandbox environment before making an onchain transaction:

   ```text
   $ node examples/11-package-imports/request.js
   secp256k1 unavailable, reverting to browser version
   Start simulation...
   Simulation result {
     capturedTerminalOutput: 'Fetched BTC / USD price: 6644228390483\n',

   }

     errorString: '',
     returnDataBytesHexstring: '0x',
     fulfillmentCode: 0
   }

   ✅ Decoded response to int256:  6644228390483n
   ```

   The output of the example gives you the following information:

   - Your request is first run on a sandbox environment to ensure it is correctly configured.
   - The fulfillment costs are estimated before making the request.
   - Your request was successfully sent to Chainlink Functions. The transaction in this example is `0xa73d895adb28360d1737a695647390a3a7f000368d976135fcfe9c834ee75ed6` and the request ID is `0x5bac800974596113a3013bf788919a6b3df5ea65ec6238a1c98114a60daff6d2`.

   - The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.236901088749168095 LINK`.
   - The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060afadf7e53`. Decoding it offchain to `int256` gives you a result: `6644228390483`.

## Examine the code

### FunctionsConsumerExample.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### JavaScript example

#### source.js

The Decentralized Oracle Network will run the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/11-package-imports/source.js). The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

<ChainlinkFunctions section="deno-importe-notes" />

The example `source.js` file uses a JSON RPC call to the [`latestRoundData()` function](/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata) of a [Chainlink Data Feed](/data-feeds).

The request requires a few modifications to work in the Chainlink Functions environment. For example, the `JsonRpcProvider` class must be inherited to override the JsonRpcProvider [`_send` method](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/jsonrpc/#JsonRpcProvider). This customization is necessary because Deno does not natively support Node.js modules like [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) or [https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html). We override the `_send` method to use the [fetch API](https://docs.deno.com/api/web/~/fetch), which is the standard way to make HTTP(s) requests in Deno. **Note**: The `url` passed in the constructor is the URL of the JSON RPC provider.

```javascript
// Chainlink Functions compatible Ethers JSON RPC provider class
// (this is required for making Ethers RPC calls with Chainlink Functions)
class FunctionsJsonRpcProvider extends ethers.JsonRpcProvider {
  constructor(url) {
    super(url)
    this.url = url
  }
  async _send(payload) {
    let resp = await fetch(this.url, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    })
    return resp.json()
  }
}
```

After the class is extended, you can initialize the provider object with the `RPC_URL` and await the response.

```javascript
const provider = new FunctionsJsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL)
const dataFeedContract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, abi, provider)
const dataFeedResponse = await dataFeedContract.latestRoundData()
```

In this example, the contract returns an `int256` value. Encode the value so request.js can properly decode it.

```javascript
return Functions.encodeInt256(dataFeedResponse.answer)
```

#### request.js

This explanation focuses on the [request.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/11-package-imports/request.js) script and shows how to use the [Chainlink Functions NPM package](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit) in your own JavaScript/TypeScript project to send requests to a DON. The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

The script imports:

- [path](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html) and [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) : Used to read the [source file](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/11-package-imports/source.js).
- [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/): Ethers.js library, enables the script to interact with the blockchain.
- `@chainlink/functions-toolkit`: Chainlink Functions NPM package. All its utilities are documented in the [NPM README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit/blob/main/README.md).
- `@chainlink/env-enc`: A tool for loading and storing encrypted environment variables. Read the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc) to learn more.
- `../abi/functionsClient.json`: The abi of the contract your script will interact with. **Note**: The script was tested with this [FunctionsConsumerExample contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerExample.sol).

The script has two hardcoded values that you have to change using your own Functions consumer contract and subscription ID:

```javascript
const consumerAddress = "0x91257aa1c6b7f382759c357fbc53c565c80f7fee" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
const subscriptionId = 38 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
```

The primary function that the script executes is `makeRequestSepolia`. This function consists of five main parts:

1. Definition of necessary identifiers:

   - `routerAddress`: Chainlink Functions router address on the Sepolia testnet.
   - `donId`: Identifier of the DON that will fulfill your requests on the Sepolia testnet.
   - `explorerUrl`: Block explorer URL of the Sepolia testnet.
   - `source`: The source code must be a string object. That's why we use `fs.readFileSync` to read `source.js` and then call `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
   - `args`: During the execution of your function, these arguments are passed to the source code.
   - `gasLimit`: Maximum gas that Chainlink Functions can use when transmitting the response to your contract.
   - Initialization of ethers `signer` and `provider` objects. The signer is used to make transactions on the blockchain, and the provider reads data from the blockchain.

1. Simulating your request in a local sandbox environment:

   - Use `simulateScript` from the Chainlink Functions NPM package.
   - Read the `response` of the simulation. If successful, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.int256` in this example).

1. Estimating the costs:

   - Initialize a `SubscriptionManager` from the Functions NPM package, then call the `estimateFunctionsRequestCost`.
   - The response is returned in Juels (1 LINK = 10\*\*18 Juels). Use the `ethers.utils.formatEther` utility function to convert the output to LINK.

1. Making a Chainlink Functions request:

   - Initialize your functions consumer contract using the contract address, abi, and ethers signer.
   - Call the `sendRequest` function of your consumer contract.

1. Waiting for the response:

   - Initialize a `ResponseListener` from the Functions NPM package and then call the `listenForResponseFromTransaction` function to wait for a response. By default, this function waits for five minutes.
   - Upon reception of the response, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.int256` in this example).
