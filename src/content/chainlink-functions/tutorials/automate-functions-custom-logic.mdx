This tutorial shows you how to use [Chainlink Automation](/chainlink-automation) to automate your Chainlink Functions. Automation is essential when you want to trigger the same function regularly, such as fetching weather data daily or fetching an asset price on every block.

Read the [Automate your Functions (Time-based Automation)](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/automate-functions) tutorial before you follow the steps in this example. This tutorial explains how to trigger your functions using an [Automation compatible contract](/chainlink-automation/guides/compatible-contracts).

After you deploy and set up your contract, Chainlink Automation triggers your function on every block.

<Aside type="caution">
  Chainlink Functions is still in BETA. The use of secrets in your requests is an experimental feature that may not
  operate as expected and is subject to change. Use of this feature is at your own risk and may result in unexpected
  errors, possible revealing of the secret as new versions are released, or other issues.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
  Chainlink Functions is a self-service solution. You must ensure that the data sources or APIs specified in requests
  are of sufficient quality and have the proper availability for your use case. You are responsible for complying with
  the licensing agreements for all data providers that you connect with through Chainlink Functions. Violations of data
  provider licensing agreements or the [terms](https://chain.link/terms) can result in suspension or termination of your
  Chainlink Functions account.

## Tutorial

This tutorial is configured to get the median `BTC/USD` price from multiple data sources on every block. Read the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section for a detailed explanation of the code example.

You can locate the scripts used in this tutorial in the [_examples/10-automate-functions_ directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/functions-examples/examples/10-automate-functions).

1. Make sure to understand the [API multiple calls](/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-multiple-calls) guide.

1. Make sure your subscription has enough LINK to pay for your requests. Also, you must maintain a minimum balance to upload encrypted secrets to the DON (Read the [minimum balance for uploading encrypted secrets section](/chainlink-functions/resources/billing#minimum-balance-for-uploading-encrypted-secrets) to learn more). You can check your subscription details (including the balance in LINK) in the [Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions). If your subscription runs out of LINK, follow the [Fund a Subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) guide. This guide recommends maintaining at least 2 LINK within your subscription.

1. Get a free API key from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) and note your API key.

1. Run `npx env-enc set` to add an encrypted `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` to your `.env.enc` file.

   ```shell
   npx env-enc set
   ```

### Deploy a Custom Automated Functions Consumer contract

<Aside type="caution">
  When using Chainlink Automation, developers should be mindful of the risks of Automation attempting to perform upkeeps
  indefinitely if a previous upkeep fails to update due to reversion. To learn more, read the [Automation best
  practices](/chainlink-automation/concepts/best-practice).
</Aside>

The consumer contract for Custom Automated Functions is different from the consumer in other tutorials. Deploy the `CustomAutomatedFunctionsConsumerExample` contract on _Ethereum Sepolia_:

1. Open the [CustomAutomatedFunctionsConsumerExample.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/CustomAutomatedFunctionsConsumerExample.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkFunctions/CustomAutomatedFunctionsConsumerExample.sol" showButtonOnly={true} />

1. Compile the contract.
1. Open MetaMask and select the _Ethereum Sepolia_ network.
1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select _Injected Provider - MetaMask_ in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with _Ethereum Sepolia_.
1. Under the **Deploy** section, fill in the router address for your specific blockchain. You can find this address on the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page. For _Ethereum Sepolia_, the router address is <CopyText text="0xb83E47C2bC239B3bf370bc41e1459A34b41238D0" code/>.
1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract to _Ethereum Sepolia_.
1. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the Deployed Contracts list. Copy your contract address.

### Add your Consumer contract to your Functions subscription

Add your contract as an approved consumer contract to your Functions subscription using the [Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager](https://functions.chain.link/).

### Configure your Consumer contract

Configure the request details by calling the `updateRequest` function. This step stores the encoded request (source code, reference to encrypted secrets if any, arguments), gas limit, subscription ID, and job ID in the contract storage (see [Examine the code](#examine-the-code)). To do so, follow these steps:

1.  On a terminal, change directories to the [_10-automate-functions_](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/functions-examples/examples/10-automate-functions) directory.
1.  Open [updateRequest.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/10-automate-functions/updateRequest.js) and replace the consumer contract address and the subscription ID with your own values:

    ```javascript
    const consumerAddress = "0x5abE77Ba2aE8918bfD96e2e382d5f213f10D39fA" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
    const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
    ```

1.  Run the [updateRequest.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/10-automate-functions/updateRequest.js) script to update your Functions consumer contract's request details.

### Configure Chainlink Automation

The consumer contract that you deployed is designed to be used with a **custom logic** automation. Follow the instructions in the [Register a Custom Logic Upkeep](/chainlink-automation/guides/register-upkeep) guide to register your deployed contract using the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/). Use the following upkeep settings:

- Trigger: Custom logic
- Target contract address: The address of the Chainlink Functions consumer contract that you deployed
- Name: Give your upkeep a name
- Check data: Leave this field blank
- Gas limit: <CopyText text="1000000" code/>
- Starting balance (LINK): <CopyText text="1" code/>

You can leave the other settings at their default values for the example in this tutorial.

At this stage, your Functions consumer contract is configured to get the median Bitcoin price on every block.

<Aside type="note" title="Monitor your balances">
There are two balances that you must monitor:

- Your subscription balance: Your balance will be charged each time your Chainlink Functions is fulfilled. If your balance is insufficient, your contract cannot send requests. Automating your Chainlink Functions means they will be regularly triggered, so monitor and fund your subscription account regularly. You can check your subscription details (including the balance in LINK) in the [Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions).
- Your upkeep balance: You can check this balance on the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/). The upkeep balance pays Chainlink Automation Network to send your requests according to your provided time interval. Chainlink Automation will not trigger your requests if your upkeep balance runs low.

</Aside>

### Check Result

Go to the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/) and connect to the Sepolia testnet. Your upkeep will be listed under _My upkeeps_:

Click on your upkeep to fetch de details:

<ClickToZoom src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/automation/myupkeep-details-custom.jpg" />

On your terminal, run the [readLatest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/10-automate-functions/readLatest.js) to read the latest received response:

1.  Open `readLatest.js` and replace the consumer contract address with your own values:

    ```javascript
    const consumerAddress = "0x5abE77Ba2aE8918bfD96e2e382d5f213f10D39fA" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
    ```

1.  Run the [readLatest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/10-automate-functions/readLatest.js) script.

    ```shell
    node examples/10-automate-functions/readLatest.js
    ```

    Output Example:

    ```text
    $ node examples/10-automate-functions/readLatest.js
    secp256k1 unavailable, reverting to browser version
    Last request ID is 0xf4ae51b028ded52d33376810cd97f02e2b1dff424bb78d45730820fefc0b8060
    âœ… Decoded response to uint256:  6688012n
    ```

### Clean up

After you finish the guide, cancel your upkeep in the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/) and withdraw the remaining funds. After you cancel the upkeep, there is a 50-block delay before you can withdraw the funds.
