<Aside type="note" title="Mainnet Beta">
Chainlink Functions is available on mainnet only as a BETA preview to ensure that this new platform is robust and secure for developers. While in BETA, developers must follow best practices and not use the BETA for any mission-critical application or secure any value. Chainlink Functions is likely to evolve and improve. Breaking changes might occur while the service is in BETA. Monitor these docs to stay updated on feature improvements along with interface and contract changes.

</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
Chainlink Functions is a self-service solution. You are responsible for independently reviewing any code and API dependencies that you submit in a request. Community-created code examples might not be audited, so you must independently review this code before you use it.

Chainlink Functions is offered "as is" and "as available" without conditions or warranties of any kind. Neither Chainlink Labs, the Chainlink Foundation, nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs from Functions due to issues in your code or downstream issues with API dependencies. You must ensure that the data sources or APIs specified in requests are of sufficient quality and have the proper availability for your use case. Users are responsible for complying with the licensing agreements for all data providers that they connect with through Chainlink Functions. Violations of data provider licensing agreements or the [terms](https://chain.link/terms) can result in suspension or termination of your Chainlink Functions account or subscription.

</Aside>

The Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager is available [here](https://functions.chain.link/). The Functions Subscription Manager lets you create a subscription, add consumers to it, remove consumers from it, fund it with LINK, and delete it.

When you connect to the Subscription Manager, choose the correct network, then click _connect wallet_.

## Subscriptions

You use a Chainlink Functions subscription to pay for, manage, and track Functions requests.

### Create a subscription

1. Open [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link/) and click _Create Subscription_:

   />

1. The first time that you interact with the Subscription Manager using your EOA, you have to approve the Terms of Service (ToS):

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/subscription/acceptTos.jpg"

## Time out pending requests manually

The Subscription Manager provides the option to time out requests manually. You can time out requests that have been pending for longer than five minutes to unlock your subscription funds.

1. Open your subscription details and scroll to the **Pending** section. If a request has been pending longer than five minutes, its status displays as _Time out required_. Click the link within the red banner that says **Time out request**:

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/request-timeout/1-request-eligible-for-timeout.png"
     alt="Pending Functions request eligible for timeout"
   />

   If you have multiple requests that are eligible for timeout, the **Time out request** link in the red banner times out all the requests at once.

   Alternatively, you can time out an individual request. Open the **Actions** menu for that request, and click **Time out request**:

   {" "}

   <ClickToZoom
     src="/images/chainlink-functions/tutorials/request-timeout/individual-request-timeout.png"
     alt="Individual request timeout"

     alt="Timeout transaction confirmation"

     alt="Chainlink Functions subscription canceled"
