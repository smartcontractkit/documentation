<Dta section="dtaNotes" />

The Digital Transfer Agent (DTA) is a suite of smart contracts that provides a standardized, blockchain-based framework for the primary issuance and redemption of tokenized investment funds. It acts as an on/off-ramp solution, creating a global, interoperable marketplace where Fund Administrators can securely interact with Fund Distributors across multiple chains.

## Modernizing and streamlining fund management

In traditional finance, transfer agents are responsible for the complex and often manual record-keeping involved in tracking fund investors and processing their transactions. This process can be slow, opaque, and fragmented across different systems.

The DTA system reimagines this role for the onchain economy. It provides a transparent, automated, and highly efficient alternative, using smart contracts to handle key operations.

## Who is DTA for?

The DTA ecosystem is designed for two primary actors:

- **Fund Administrators:** Entities who manage and operate tokenized investment funds.
- **Fund Distributors:** Entities who invest in funds on behalf of their clients, such as wealth management platforms, brokers, or institutional investors.

To learn more about the specific responsibilities of each role, see the [Actors in the Ecosystem](/dta/actors) page.

## Core Features

{/* NOTE: This is less technical than the developer version */}

| Feature                        | What it means operationally                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flexible Settlement Models** | Offchain wires, same-chain atomic token/payment settlement, and cross-chain settlement via CCIP are supported per fund configuration. Operators communicate the applicable model during onboarding. |
| **Granular Access Control**    | Distributors must be explicitly **allowlisted** per fund before submitting requests, ensuring controlled, compliant access.                                                                         |
| **Operational Controls**       | Daily request limits and **timezone-based cutoff windows** are enforced at the marketplace/wallet layer.                                                                                            |
| **Cross-Chain Native**         | Requests may originate on one chain and settle on another using **CCIP**, enabling L2 distribution with L1 settlement.                                                                              |
| **Token Compatibility**        | Works with standardized fund tokens that expose compliance configuration. Administrators handle requirements during onboarding; the protocol abstracts token internals for Distributors.            |

## DTA and token compliance

It is important to understand the separation of concerns between the DTA protocol and your Fund Token's own compliance layer.

- **DTA's Role:** The DTA protocol manages the operational flow of primary issuance and redemption. Its distributor allowlisting feature acts as a first-level access control, determining who can receive shares directly from the issuer.
- **Token's Role:** The DTA does **not** enforce rules on secondary transfers (re-selling). Your Fund Token contract is solely responsible for its own comprehensive compliance, including KYC/AML checks and transfer restrictions, to prevent shares from being moved to unauthorized wallets.
