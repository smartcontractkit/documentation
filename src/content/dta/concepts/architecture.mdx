The Digital Transfer Agent (DTA) architecture is designed around a core principle: **separation of concerns**. This ensures a system that is secure, decentralized, and flexible. The architecture clearly distinguishes between the public-facing "marketplace" where users interact and the private, secure "wallets" where fund operations occur.

This design allows for a multi-tenant public marketplace to coexist with single-tenant, admin-controlled operational vaults, providing both open discovery and robust security.

## Core components

### DTA Open Marketplace: The front office

Think of the DTA Open Marketplace as the "front office" or lobby of the system. It serves as the central hub for discovery and requests, supporting multiple organizations.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Global Registry:** Maintains onchain registries of all Fund Administrators, Fund Distributors, and the Fund Tokens they list.
- **Request Intake:** Acts as the single entry point for all subscription and redemption requests from distributors.
- **Initial Validation & Calculation:** When a fund administrator initiates processing, the DTA Open Marketplace validates requests against operational rules (such as rate limits and time zones) and calculates final share or payment amounts using the net asset value feed.
- **Request Routing:** After processing, it forwards finalized request details to the appropriate private vault for settlement.

### DTA Wallet: The back office

The DTA Wallet is a secure "back office" or vault deployed and owned by each Fund Administrator. It is the workhorse of the system, handling the actual movement of assets the core settlement logic.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Asset Custody:** Holds the authority to manage investment product tokens, securely storing newly created tokens during offchain settlements.
- **Settlement Engine:** Receives finalized instructions from the DTA Open Marketplace and executes settlements, including transferring payment tokens, managing tokens, and releasing tokens from escrow.
- **Access Control:** Maintains a list of approved DTA Open Marketplaces allowed to send requests, preventing unauthorized interactions.

## Interaction patterns

Communication between the "front office" (DTA Open Marketplace) and "back office" (DTA Wallet) is designed for flexibility, supporting both local and cross-chain operations.

- **Local Interaction (Same Network):** If the DTA Wallet is on the same blockchain as the DTA Open Marketplace, the marketplace makes a direct call to deliver settlement instructions.
- **Remote Interaction (Cross-Network):** If the DTA Wallet is on a different blockchain, the DTA Open Marketplace uses secure cross-chain messaging to send settlement instructions, which the DTA Wallet receives and processes.

This dual-interaction pattern allows the DTA system to function as both a local application and a globally interconnected protocol, without changing its core logic.
