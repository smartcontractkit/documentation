import { Aside, Accordion } from "@components"

Workflows for processing new blocks and transactions using block-triggered webhooks (from Alchemy Notify) and matching against watched addresses. These workflows demonstrate the **block trigger pattern** where the workflow reacts to incoming block data and extracts relevant transactions.

## Overview

These workflows demonstrate how to:

- React to block events via HTTP webhook triggers (We use Alchemy Notify for this workflow)
- Match transactions to a list of watched addresses
- Process and return JSON-formatted block and transaction data
- Implement the same logic in both Go and TypeScript

Both workflows process incoming block data and extract:

- Block number, hash, timestamp
- All transactions in the block
- Transactions where the `to` address matches a watched address

## Workflows

<Accordion title="block-trigger-go (Go Implementation)" number={1}>

**Language:** Go

**Features:**

- Uses `http.Trigger` from CRE Go SDK
- Matches transactions to watched addresses from config
- Returns formatted JSON summary of block and matched transactions

**Running the workflow:**

```bash
cd building-blocks/indexer-block-trigger/block-trigger-go
cre workflow simulate workflow --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --http-payload test-block.json --target staging-settings
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="block-trigger-ts (TypeScript Implementation)" number={2}>

**Language:** TypeScript

**Features:**

- Uses HTTP trigger from CRE TypeScript SDK
- Matches transactions to watched addresses from config
- Returns formatted JSON summary of block and matched transactions

**Running the workflow:**

```bash
cd building-blocks/indexer-block-trigger/block-trigger-ts/workflow
bun install
cre workflow simulate workflow --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --http-payload test-block.json --target staging-settings
```

</Accordion>

## Setup and Testing

<Accordion title="Prerequisites" number={1}>

**For Go workflow:**

1. Install CRE CLI
2. Login: `cre login`
3. Install Go

**For TypeScript workflow:**

1. Install CRE CLI
2. Login: `cre login`
3. Install Bun (or Node.js)
4. Run `bun install` in the workflow directory

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Running the Workflows" number={2}>

**Go Workflow:**

```bash
cd building-blocks/indexer-block-trigger/block-trigger-go
cre workflow simulate workflow --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --http-payload test-block.json --target staging-settings
```

**TypeScript Workflow:**

```bash
cd building-blocks/indexer-block-trigger/block-trigger-ts
cre workflow simulate workflow --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --http-payload test-block.json --target staging-settings
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example Output" number={3}>

Both workflows return JSON output like:

```json
{
  "blockNumber": 12345678,
  "blockHash": "0xabc...",
  "timestamp": 1700000000,
  "totalLogs": 42,
  "uniqueTransactions": 10,
  "matchedTransactions": 2,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "hash": "0xdef...",
      "from": "0x...",
      "to": "0x73b668d8374ddb42c9e2f46fd5b754ac215495bc",
      "value": "1000000000000000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Setting Up Alchemy Webhooks

<Accordion title="Step-by-step Alchemy setup" number={1}>

To use Alchemy for block-triggered workflows, follow these steps:

1. Sign up on Alchemy and navigate to their dashboard.
2. Create a new app on the dashboard with your preferred network.
3. Click on your app to open the app dashboard and scroll down to the `services` section.
4. Click on the Webhooks service and in the pane that opens, click on `Real-time Notifications`, then click on `Get Started`.
5. Choose webhook type `Custom` to listen for new blocks or events on every new block.
6. In the custom webhook pane, add other details including webhook name, chain, network, query template, and webhook URL.
7. Click on `Create Webhook` to save the webhook and test the webhook URL.

**Tips:**

- Make sure your webhook URL is accessible and correctly configured to receive POST requests.
- You may want to use a tool like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) for initial testing.
- Double-check the network and chain settings to match your workflow requirements.
- The query template should match the data you want to extract from each block/event.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Monitoring High-Value Addresses

Track transactions to specific addresses in real time:

```json
{
  "watchedAddresses": ["0x...", "0x..."]
}
```

### 2. Contract Interaction Tracking

Detect when contracts of interest receive transactions:

```json
{
  "watchedAddresses": ["0xContract1", "0xContract2"]
}
```

### 3. Block-Level Analytics

Summarize block activity and matched transactions for analytics dashboards.
