## What This Template Does

This template provides an end-to-end starting point for writing your own multi-chain token manager that maximizes supply APY by rebalancing tokens cross-chain with the **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)** via the **Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)**.

The template consists of two components:

- **Contracts** (deployed on multiple chains)
  - `MockPool` contract that mimics an AAVE liquidity pool
  - `ProtocolSmartWallet` contract that manages lending positions
- **CRE Workflow** that monitors supply APY of a target asset on each chain and automatically rebalances lending positions (to maximize supply APY)
  - **Golang** workflow targeting the Golang CRE SDK
  - **TypeScript** workflow targeting the TypeScript CRE SDK

**Key Technologies:**

- **CRE (Chainlink Runtime Environment)** - Orchestrates workflow with DON consensus
- **CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)** - Secure token bridging with instructions

## Getting Started

You can build with the **CRE SDK** in either **Golang** or **TypeScript**.

<Accordion title="Golang SDK" number={1}>

For detailed instructions on getting started with the Go SDK, see the [Go README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-templates/blob/main/starter-templates/multi-chain-token-manager/workflow-go/README.md) on GitHub.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="TypeScript SDK" number={2}>

For detailed instructions on getting started with the TypeScript SDK, see the [TypeScript README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-templates/blob/main/starter-templates/multi-chain-token-manager/workflow-ts/README.md) on GitHub.

## Security Considerations

1. **This is a demo project** - Not production-ready
2. **Contracts are examples** - Write your own audited contracts for your use case
3. **Use your own RPC for stability** - For stable deployment and chainwrite operations it is advised to use your own private RPCs
4. **Secrets hygiene** – Keep real secrets out of version control; use secure secret managers for `.env` values.
