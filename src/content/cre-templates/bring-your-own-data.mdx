## What This Template Does

This template provides an end-to-end starting point for bringing your own off-chain Proof-of-Reserve (PoR) or Net-Asset-Value (NAV) data on-chain with the **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)**.

The template consists of two components:

- **Contracts** (deployed on multiple chains)
  - [DataFeedsCache](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-evm/blob/88d90433a15f1c34bb5fabc29be192400fad396c/contracts/src/v0.8/data-feeds/DataFeedsCache.sol) contract that receives data on-chain
  - DecimalAggregatorProxy proxy contract for PoR data stored in the DataFeedsCache contract
  - [BundleAggregatorProxy](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-evm/blob/88d90433a15f1c34bb5fabc29be192400fad396c/contracts/src/v0.8/data-feeds/BundleAggregatorProxy.sol) proxy contract for NAV data stored in the DataFeedsCache contract
- **CRE Workflows**
  - **Golang** workflows targeting the Golang CRE SDK
    - PoR Workflow (Proof-of-Reserve)
    - NAV Workflow (Net-Asset-Value)
  - **TypeScript** workflows targeting the TypeScript CRE SDK
    - PoR Workflow (Proof-of-Reserve)
    - NAV Workflow (Net-Asset-Value)

**Key Technologies:**

- **CRE (Chainlink Runtime Environment)** - Orchestrates workflows with DON consensus

## Getting Started

You can build with the **CRE SDK** in either **Golang** or **TypeScript**.

<Accordion title="Golang SDK" number={1}>

For detailed instructions on getting started with the Go SDK, see the [Go README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-templates/blob/main/starter-templates/bring-your-own-data/workflow-go/README.md) on GitHub.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="TypeScript SDK" number={2}>

For detailed instructions on getting started with the TypeScript SDK, see the [TypeScript README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/cre-templates/blob/main/starter-templates/bring-your-own-data/workflow-ts/README.md) on GitHub.

## Security Considerations

1. **This is a demo project** - Not production-ready
2. **DecimalAggregatorProxy contract is demo contract** - Not audited and not production-ready
3. **Use your own RPC for stability** - For stable deployment and chainwrite operations it is advised to use your own private RPCs
4. **Secrets hygiene** – Keep real secrets out of version control; use secure secret managers for `.env` values.
