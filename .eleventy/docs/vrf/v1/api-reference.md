### Functions

| Name                                    | Description                                                  |

| [requestRandomness](#requestrandomness) | Make a request to the VRFCoordinator.                        |
| [fulfillRandomness](#fulfillrandomness) | Called by VRFCoordinator when it receives a valid VRF proof. |

## Constructor

Initialize your consuming contract.

```javascript Solidity
constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _link) public
```

- `_vrfCoordinator`: Address of the Chainlink VRF Coordinator. See [Chainlink VRF Addresses](/docs/vrf/v1/supported-networks/) for details.
- `_link`: Address of the LINK token. See [LINK Token Addresses](/docs/link-token-contracts/) for details.

---

> Note: `_seed` has recently been deprecated.

## Functions

### requestRandomness

Make a request to the VRF coordinator.

```javascript Solidity
function requestRandomness(bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _fee)
    public returns (bytes32 requestId)
```

- `_keyHash`: The public key against which randomness is generated. See [Chainlink VRF supported networks](/docs/vrf/v1/supported-networks) for details.
- `_fee`: The fee, in LINK, for the request. Specified by the oracle.
- `RETURN`: The ID unique to a single request.

### fulfillRandomness

Called by VRFCoordinator when it receives a valid VRF proof. Override this function to act upon the random number generated by Chainlink VRF.

```javascript Solidity
function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness)
    internal virtual;
```

- `requestId`: The ID initially returned by `requestRandomness`.
- `randomness`: The random number generated by Chainlink VRF.

### Maximizing security

Chainlink VRF provides powerful security guarantees and is easy to integrate. However, smart contract security is a nuanced topic. You can read about the [top security considerations for VRF](/docs/vrf/v1/security).
