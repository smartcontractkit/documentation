{/* Optional - A prerequisites section with an unordered list of what you need before you begin the tutorial. */}

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, complete the following items:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

{/* Heading names with ## <h2> style. If <h3> or <h4> are required for sub-sections, add more # characters. */}

## Setup the example

{/* Rename this heading to an imperative sentence relevant and specific to the task in this guide */}

{/* A brief description of the components the user will set up in the tutorial. Include an unordered list with heading links to the sub-sections */}
This tutorial requires you to set up two primary components:

- [Component 1](#setup-sub-section-1)
- [Component 2](#setup-sub-section-1)

{/* Use sub-sections for major components of the tutorial. Usually multiple major components go into creating a tutorial. Separate each one into a different section if it makes sense. */}

### Setup sub-section 1

{/_
Optional - Use the <Aside> component to call extra attention to risks, warnings, or potential issues.
Available types are:
note
tip
caution
danger
_/}

<Aside type="note" title="Example notice">
  Example notice.
</Aside>

{/* Brief description of what components you are setting up and why it is necessary for the guide. */}
Run `./setup-example` to install the required config files.

{/* An ordered list of steps to run with example output and descriptions of each step where possible. */}

1. Run the `./setup-example` command.

   {/* Command to run for setting up */}

   ```shell
   ./setup-example
   ```

   This command prints the expected result.

   {/* Command output */}

   ```text
   Expected results
   ```

1. {/* Step 2 */}

   1. {/* Sub-step A */}
   1. {/* Sub-step B */}

1. {/* Step 3 */}

{/* Sub-section 2 - Add additional sub sections for each major component of the tutorial. */}

### Setup sub-section 2

{/* The section for running the tutorial and reaching the final result. */}

## Run the example

{/* Rename this heading to an imperative sentence relevant and specific to the task in this guide */}

{/* Brief description for running or deploying the completed tutorial result. This section should be the final section of the tutorial instructions. */}
Run the example in a terminal. When you are done, you will have a complete running solution.

{/* An ordered list of steps to run with example output and descriptions of what is happening in each step. */}

1. Run the `./run-tutorial` command.

   {/* Command to run */}

   ```shell
   ./run-tutorial
   ```

   This command prints the expected result.

   {/* Command output */}

   ```text
   Expected result
   ```

1. {/* Step 2 */}

1. {/* Step 3 */}

{/* Optional - Include code examples and a description of how it works. If there are specific best practices or details that you want to call out, highlight them. */}

### Code example

The main part of this tutorial is the [`test.js` script](samples/productName/tutorialName/test.js).

{/* Add the code sample to the /public/samples folder and reference it using the CodeSample component. */}

<CodeSample src="samples/productName/tutorialName/test.js" />

{/* Describe the important parts of the code example and what they accomplish. */}
This example has the following components:

- `const test`: An example constant storing a string.
- `print()`: A function used to print `test` to the console.
