        Chainlink turns your smart contracts into hybrid smart contracts, giving them access to real-world data and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chainlink services are now available on networks outside of the Ethereum EVM ecosystem. These services run natively on their respective networks and have no dependencies on other blockchains.
